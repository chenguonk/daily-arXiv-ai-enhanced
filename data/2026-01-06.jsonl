Recent observations support engulfment as the cause of such signatures; however, many engulfment process details remain uncertain. Here, we present a model for determining the chemical signatures produced due to the pollution of main sequence stars by rocky planets, a common engulfment scenario due to the high frequency of observed short-period rocky exoplanets. A key novel element of our model is that we calculate the gradual evaporation of the planet due to drag interactions with the stellar envelope, which can lead to observable pollution on the stellar surface even if the bulk of the planet is only destroyed below the star's outer convective zone. Our results indicate that rocky planet pollution is most easily measurable for stars in the $1.0$ to $1.4$ M$_\\odot$ range and that elements such as aluminium, calcium, and vanadium, in addition to lithium, are most suited to detect pollution. We predict that it is also possible to differentiate between the engulfment of one large planet versus several small planets, for the same total pollution mass, for some stellar hosts. We find that rocky planet engulfment events generally take years to decades for most stars. Our results can guide future observational campaigns that may search for sites of past or current engulfment events."}

There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$α$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $α$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation."}

We examine the possible roles of planetary interiors, tectonic regimes, continental coverage, volatile cycling, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition and evolution in shaping long-term climate stability and biospheric potential. Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth's history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take. Thus, exo-geoscience provides a framework for interpreting exoplanet diversity and refining strategies for detecting life beyond the Solar System."}

Tarczay-Nehéz"], "title": "Trajectory-Based Dust Evolution in Disks: First Results from the RAPID Simulation Code", "comment": "Submitted to CMDA", "summary": "The rapid depletion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks limits the time available for planetesimal formation, as solids are typically accreted onto the central star before dust particles can undergo substantial growth. Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \\texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\\sim 0.005\\,M_\\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\\,M_\\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \\texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth."}

The SEDs are constructed out of new and archival Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and/or XMM-Newton data combined with spectra from models or stars with similar properties (proxies) filling in unobserved gaps. We have also constructed SEDs of likely Habitable Worlds Observatory targets $κ^1$ Ceti, $τ$ Ceti, $ε$ Indi and 70 Oph B for use as proxies. We find that the JWST target planets almost all experience much stronger ultraviolet fluxes than the Earth, especially in the extreme ultraviolet, even for planets with similar overall instellation. Strong ongoing or past atmospheric escape is possible for a majority of these planets. We also assess the now considerable sample of panchromatic stellar SEDs and its applicability for current JWST observations and beyond."}

It is the primary factor limiting the accuracy of orbit determination for such satellites. Up to now, numerous SRP models have been proposed for artificial satellites close to the Earth, but these models have their shortcomings when applied to satellites in the cislunar space. In this study, we concentrate on various scenarios of cislunar satellites in periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We first employ the box-wing model to simulate the SRP effects and then propose an appropriate general SRP model based on these simulations, termed Empirical NJU Cislunar Model (ENCM). Additionally, several scenario-specific sub-models suited to different mission profiles are developed. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified in the orbit determination process. Comparisons with the conventional cannonball and ECOM models demonstrate that the ENCM model yields a significant improvement in orbit determination accuracy, showing promising potential for future cislunar missions."}

With JWST's sensitivity, we now have the opportunity to identify these planets thought to be responsible for the observed substructures in debris discs. We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 μm coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances. Finally, we conclude that the planets causing the proper motion anomaly in these systems must reside within the inner 20 au."}

Utilizing the full baseline of TESS photometry (54 sectors), we recover a periodic signal with $P = 0.52067$ d and a shallow depth of $\\sim$158 ppm. To assess the planetary nature of the candidate, we performed a rigorous vetting process combining centroid analysis, Bayesian model comparison, and false-positive probability calculations. While the low signal-to-noise ratio of the sub-Earth candidate yielded inconclusive formal statistical validation metrics (FPP) and Bayesian evidence ($Δ\\ln Z$), we demonstrate the planetary nature of the system through physical exclusion of false positive scenarios. The TRICERATOPS Nearby False Positive Probability (NFPP) of 0.0000, combined with centroid stability, rules out background contamination. Furthermore, we calculate that a stellar-mass companion at the derived orbital separation ($a \\approx 5 R_\\star$) would induce ellipsoidal variations of order $\\gtrsim 5000$ ppm.

We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive."}

Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a \"cavity\", have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where \"molecule-rich\" (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while \"molecule-poor\" (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $μ$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time."}
