The nominal total solar irradiance, ${S}^{\\rm N}_{\\odot}$, while based on a current best estimate with uncertainties, was adopted to be an exact reference value of 1361 W m$^{-2}$ by IAU 2015 Resolution B3, corresponding to ``the mean total electromagnetic energy from the Sun, integrated over all wavelengths, incident per unit area per unit time at distance 1 au''. In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for ``flux'', ``insolation'', ``instellation'', etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent. To simplify the quoting of irradiance units for astronomical applications, we introduce the portmanteau solirad, short for solar irradiance, as an abbreviated version of the longer IAU term ``nominal total solar irradiance''. The solirad (So) is a unit of irradiance, where 1 solirad = 1 So = 1361 W m$^{-2}$, equivalent to the IAU nominal total solar irradiance, and to an apparent bolometric magnitude of $m_{bol}$ = -26.832 mag (per IAU 2015 Resolution B2)."}
