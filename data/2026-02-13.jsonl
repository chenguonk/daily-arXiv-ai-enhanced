The planets have orbital periods between 2.2 and 29.3 days, and span the radius valley within a single planetary system. The derived densities indicate that LHS 1903 b is rocky, while LHS 1903 c and LHS 1903 d have extended atmospheres.

While in-situ formation of npFe via reduction of native Fe-bearing minerals has long been considered a dominant pathway, recent mineralogical evidence from X.Zeng et al. (2025) reveals that the source of a significant fraction of npFe may be delivered directly by exotic micrometeoroid impacts (exotic npFe). Yet the atomic-scale processes governing how exotic np-Fe forms and survives during hypervelocity impacts remain largely unknown. To quantitatively compare in-situ and exotic delivery and formation of npFe, we perform a series of innovative atomistic modeling of micrometeoroid impacts with distinct projectile target compositions: (1) SiO$_2$ projectiles on Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ targets (in-situ formation), (2) Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ projectiles on SiO$_2$ targets (exotic delivery). Our results reveal distinct mechanistic fingerprints: in-situ np-Fe forms diffusely and radially around the impact site, whereas exotic np-Fe is efficiently retained and concentrated in asymmetric, momentum-aligned clusters. These contrasting spatial signatures provide a potential diagnostic criterion for distinguishing exotic versus in-situ np-Fe in returned lunar soils. In agreement with Chang'e-5 observations, our simulations demonstrate that exotic np-Fe production can be substantial, particularly in Fe-poor terrains such as highland regions. These findings highlight the need to account for exotic np-Fe when interpreting space weathering processes and remote-sensing data for the Moon and other airless bodies."}

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Warm Jupiters-giant exoplanets with orbital periods between 10 and 200 days-exhibit a broad range of eccentricities and are often accompanied by nearby low-mass planets. Understanding the origins of their orbital architectures requires examining both their migration histories and subsequent dynamical interactions. In this study, we perform extensive N-body simulations to explore how distant giant planet perturbers affect the eccentricity evolution of warm Jupiters and the role of nearby super-Earth companions in mediating these interactions. We find that while distant perturbers can induce large-amplitude eccentricity oscillations in warm Jupiters via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, the presence of nearby super-Earth companions often suppresses these variations via strong dynamical coupling. This mechanism naturally leads to a bimodal eccentricity distribution: warm Jupiters with nearby companions tend to maintain low eccentricities, whereas those without exhibit significantly broader eccentricity distributions. We show that reproducing the observed eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters lacking nearby companions is most naturally explained if a substantial fraction of distant perturbers occupy dynamically extreme orbits, either with large mutual inclinations or high orbital eccentricities. These results support a scenario in which warm Jupiters experience substantial post-disk dynamical evolution, shaped jointly by distant perturbers and nearby companions."}

The hierarchical clustering method provides formal identification with 3,863 members, but this set also includes objects from the neighboring Koronis2 and Kuitaisi families, as well as interlopers originating from the much older Koronis family. By tracking the trajectories of cluster objects backward in time, we identified 2,161 asteroids whose orbits converged with that of their parent body (832) Karin at $5.72\\pm 0.09$ My ago ($95$\\% C.L.). This method of calculating the family's age is based on a novel convergence metric that is directly related to the velocities at which fragments were ejected from (832) Karin. We analyze the extent to which members $\\leq 1.5$ km in diameter had drifted in semimajor axis due to Yarkovsky thermal forces and find it reflects the tilt of their rotation poles away from the ecliptic, recording the influence of the YORP torque. Karin's size frequency distribution in the $\\simeq(0.8-3)$ km range follows a power-law with a cumulative slope index $-3.20\\pm 0.01$. Removing members of the Karin family from the original group, we examine the Koronis2 family, whose members are associated with (158) Koronis. We find it difficult for large members of the Koronis2 family to converge with the orbit of (158) Koronis within its previously estimated age of $7.6$ My. Achieving such convergence would require the Koronis2 family to be older than $10$ My, but our result must be verified with a direct numerical approach in the future."}

The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\\lesssim 2$~s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \\times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\\mathrm{s} \\leq τ\\lesssim 15~\\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\lesssim 0.10$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case.

Vertical-net-flux regime", "comment": "24 pages, 27 figures", "summary": "The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a relatively well-ionised, turbulent active zone located interior to a poorly ionised 'dead' zone. In this second paper, we investigate a model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of discs threaded by a large-scale poloidal-net-flux magnetic field. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, the interface acts as a one-way barrier to inward transport of large-scale magnetic flux from the dead zone. This leads to magnetic flux depletion throughout most of the active zone, whereby it either advects inwards to the inner numerical boundary or accumulates just inside the interface. Second, two sources of strong variability emerge from the interface due to the difficulty of maintaining a constant, vertically integrated electrical current across distinct and evolving magnetic-field states. Third, despite the weak magnetothermal wind in the dead zone, a pressure maximum forms at the interface, leading to Rossby-wave-induced vortices. Fourth, unlike the model of Iwasaki et. al (2024), there is no 'transition zone' devoid of magnetic flux and magnetic winds. Instead, multiple outflow zones span all disc radii reflecting the radially varying launch conditions, with an inner turbulent wind impinging upon an outer, more laminar one. Fifth, a heated corona prevents the 'puffing up' of poloidal-net-flux, active disc regions."}

A primordial interpretation based on differences in bulk densities -- where rocky and water-rich planets form via migration pathways -- offers an alternative to atmospheric loss scenarios. Updated interior structure models of water worlds with adiabatic steam atmospheres reproduce the observed valley near $\\sim2~R_\\oplus$ more accurately. Furthermore, migration models from our Genesis library suggest that these formation pathways can also account for the distinct period distributions of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, as well as the emergence of the hot Neptune desert. Motivated by this, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for close-in Kepler planets ($P<100$ days), combining rocky planets and water worlds without H/He envelopes. The inferred mass distributions of rocky and water-rich planets peak at $\\sim2.6~M_\\oplus$ and $\\sim7~M_\\oplus$, respectively, with the water mass fraction of water worlds peaking at $\\sim41\\%$. Water worlds provide a good representation of the Kepler sub-Neptune population, with the radius cliff emerging as a ``waterfall\" -- a sharp decline in their occurrence.

We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $σ\\sqrt{2\\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $σ$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \\lesssim σ$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history."}

A thermophysical model together with a radiative transfer model suggest a thermal inertia of 13$\\pm$10 [J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.5}$], an equivalent emissivity of 0.8$\\pm$0.1, a loss tangent of 0.4$\\pm$0.3, and an index of refraction 1.8$\\pm$0.3. Based on previous laboratory measurements, the modeled index of refraction suggests a regolith porosity of about 45%. However, thermal inertia models using the material parameters of ordinary chondrite indicate a grain size of 10s $μ$m and require a high porosity of $\\sim$90% to explain the low thermal inertia. In order to explain such a contradiction, we postulate that some repulsive mechanism might be in effect to reduce the contact of grains and therefore the thermal inertia. The loss tangent of Juno's regolith corrected for the modeled thermal skin depth is in the order of 0.5, much higher than that of the lunar regolith and indicating an electrical skin depth of L = 0.1 - 1.4 mm that is within the thermal skin depth. The shape of the rotational lightcurve of Juno in the mm wavelengths is dominated by its irregular shape, but rotational variations in the thermal and/or dielectric properties cannot be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that mm-wavelength observations of asteroids provide an extra dimension of constraints to the porosity and grain size of asteroid regolith compared to the thermal infrared observations."}

We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling."}

Owen"], "title": "Oxygen left behind: Atmospheric Enrichment due to Fractionation in Sub-Neptunes using BOREAS", "comment": null, "summary": "The evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres is strongly influenced by atmospheric escape, particularly for close-in planets. Fractionation during atmospheric loss can preferentially remove lighter elements such as hydrogen, while retaining heavier species like oxygen. In this study, we investigate how and under what conditions hydrodynamic escape and chemical fractionation jointly shape the mass and composition of exoplanet atmospheres, especially for mixed H2 + H2O atmospheres. We develop BOREAS, a self-consistent mass loss model coupling a 1D Parker wind formulation with a mass-dependent fractionation scheme, which we apply across a range of planet masses, radii, equilibrium temperatures, and incident XUV fluxes, allowing us to track hydrogen and oxygen escape rates at different snapshots in time. We find that oxygen is efficiently retained over most of the parameter space. Significant oxygen loss occurs under high incident XUV fluxes, while at intermediate fluxes oxygen loss is largely confined to low-gravity planets. Where oxygen is retained, irradiation is too weak to drive significant escape of hydrogen and thus limiting atmospheric enrichment. By contrast, our model predicts that sub-Neptunes undergo substantial atmospheric enrichment over approx. 200 Myr when hydrogen escape is efficient and accompanied by partial oxygen entrainment. Notably, our results imply that sub-Neptunes near the radius valley can evolve into water-rich planets, in agreement with GJ 9827 d. Present-day water-rich atmospheres may have originated from water-poor envelopes under some conditions, highlighting the need to include chemical fractionation in evolution models. BOREAS is publicly available."}
