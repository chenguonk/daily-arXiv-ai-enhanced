Abstract: Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can
influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one
planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via
planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken
into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars
in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect
young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the
absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet
system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with
another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these
external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by
a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of
encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a
"preferred" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was
perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the
reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation
in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5,
5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner
planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The
reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.

TL;DR: 比较线性混合模型与辐射传输模型在分析木卫二表面水冰和硫酸八水合物混合物光谱时的性能差异，发现辐射传输模型更准确，但在特定成分范围内两种方法都可用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估两种常用光谱建模方法（线性混合模型和基于辐射传输的亲密混合模型）在约束木卫二表面成分时的准确性，为行星表面成分分析提供方法指导。

Method: 使用近红外波长（1.2-2.5μm）下测量的水冰和硫酸八水合物混合物实验室光谱，颗粒尺寸为90-106μm，比较线性混合模型和辐射传输模型的性能。

Result: 辐射传输模型更接近实验室测量的真实丰度，偏差在±5%以内；线性混合模型偏差稍大，为±5-15%。两种方法都倾向于高估硫酸八水合物丰度、低估水冰丰度。

Conclusion: 辐射传输模型是约束木卫二表面成分的首选方法，但在硫酸八水合物占主导或微量存在时，线性混合模型也能在±10%不确定度内提供可接受的结果。

Abstract: Europa's surface composition and physical characteristics are commonly
constrained using spectral deconvolution through linear mixture (LM) modeling
and radiative transfer-based (RT) intimate mixture modeling. Here, I compared
the results of these two spectral modeling- LM versus RT- against laboratory
spectra of water (H$_{2}$O) ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO;
H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O) mixtures measured at near-infrared wavelengths
($\sim$1.2-2.5 $\mu$m) with grain sizes of 90-106 $\mu$m (Hayes and Li, 2025).
The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the
laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and
H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\sim$100 $\mu$m grains. In contrast, the
LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\pm$5-15% from
the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently
overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate
H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when
H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (>80% as observed on Europa's
trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts
($\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013;
Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within
$\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for
constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains
viable in specific compositional regimes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the
atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting
meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we
model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km.
The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower
thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals
and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids
fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond
150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak,
long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation
and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that
FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival "N-waves," broadening
potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other
atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS
structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of
wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global
infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket
launches, and large-scale explosions).

TL;DR: 本研究利用ALMA和NOEMA观测数据，分析了T Tauri星SSTTau042021周围侧向盘的气体和尘埃特性，首次直接观测到CO和HCO+气体沿中平面的垂直分子分层结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侧向盘提供了直接检查其垂直结构的独特机会，有助于深入了解行星形成过程。研究旨在估算气体和尘埃的径向和垂直温度、密度分布。

Method: 使用ALMA档案数据（CO同位素和连续谱发射）和新的NOEMA HCO+ 3-2观测数据，结合层析方法和DiskFit模型反演气体和尘埃盘特性。

Result: 发现CO垂直发射非常扩展，部分追踪JWST观测到的H2风。尘埃和气体中平面温度约7-11K，分子层温度约16K。直接观测到CO和HCO+气体延伸到尘埃外半径之外（≥300 au），估算气体+尘埃盘质量约为4.6×10^-2 M⊙。

Conclusion: 由于有利的盘倾角，首次提供了垂直分子分层的定量证据，直接观测到CO和HCO+气体沿中平面分布，并估算了温度剖面：中平面附近7-11K，分子层密集部分15-20K，上方可达约35K。

Abstract: Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their
vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation
processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$
gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS
J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical
temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA
archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm
together with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust
disk properties using the tomographic method and the \textsc{DiskFit} model.
Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the
H$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission
characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane
temperatures of $\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived
from $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being
thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\sim 3
\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The
atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\sim$ 31 K at a radius of
100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the
dust outer radius ($\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a
radius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}_\odot$.
Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first
quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct
observation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the
temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K
in the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\sim$ 35 K above.

TL;DR: JWST观测发现LTT-9779 b这颗位于"热海王星沙漠"中的超热海王星拥有富含碳的大气层，主要成分为CO和CO2，碳氧比接近1，金属度超过500倍太阳值，这有助于其在大气逃逸强烈的极端环境中维持大气层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究位于"热海王星沙漠"中的LTT-9779 b如何在这种极端环境下维持大气层，以及其大气成分和化学特性。

Method: 使用JWST NIRSpec G395H进行相位曲线观测，分析近红外波段的发射光谱，探测大气成分。

Result: 探测到CO和CO2为主要成分，混合比分别为10^-1和10^-4，还检测到水蒸气和二氧化硫，推断碳氧比接近1，金属度超过500倍太阳值。

Conclusion: LTT-9779 b通过高金属度提高了平均分子量，减少大气逃逸，从而在极端辐射环境下维持了富含碳的大气层，成为研究大气逃逸和极端条件下化学过程的宝贵实验室。

Abstract: LTT-9779 b is an ultra-hot Neptune (Rp ~ 4.7 Re, Mp ~ 29 Me) orbiting its
Sun-like host star in just 19 hours, placing it deep within the "hot Neptune
desert," where Neptunian planets are seldom found. We present new JWST NIRSpec
G395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in
unprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the
high-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal
emission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon
monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all
orbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2,
indicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also
moderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide
(SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical
production under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a
carbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O ~ 1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X
Solar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature
atmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing
atmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere
despite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where
few planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot
Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate. This makes LTT-9779 b a
valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes
under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in
the hot Neptune desert.

TL;DR: 研究发现小行星密度与宿主恒星的[Mg/Fe]丰度呈强烈负相关，表明低[Mg/Fe]环境形成铁核更大、密度更高的行星，揭示了银河系化学演化与岩石行星形成之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索岩石行星内部性质与宿主恒星化学成分之间的关系，特别是在M矮星周围行星的研究相对缺乏的情况下。

Method: 使用斯隆数字巡天-V/银河系测绘仪和数据处理框架，获取22颗岩石行星的FGK和M矮星宿主恒星的元素丰度，分析行星密度与[Mg/Fe]丰度的相关性。

Result: 发现行星密度与FGK宿主恒星的[Mg/Fe]丰度呈强烈负相关(p=0.001)，加入M矮星宿主后相关性更显著(p=0.0005)，表明低[Mg/Fe]环境形成铁核更大、密度更高的行星。

Conclusion: 银河系化学演化与岩石行星形成存在密切联系，地球类行星的组成可能在不同银河系区域存在显著差异，厚盘行星样本有助于锚定这一趋势。

Abstract: Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we
assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear
correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry
remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets
around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical
information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$
$\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances.
We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying
data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22
rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse
relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation
becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we
assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests
that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus
higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend,
illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of
host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic
chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like
planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the
Galaxy.
