Water production rates were calculated from each image of 3I/ATLAS using the methodology of Mäkinen & Combi (2005, Icarus 177, 217) and fluorescence rates calculated using the daily solar Lyman-alpha fluxes from the LASP database corrected for solar rotation. The method has been used for over 90 comet apparitions (Combi 2022; Combi et al 2019). A water production rate of 3.17 x 10^29 s^-1 was found on November 6 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.40 au and at a sufficient solar elongation angle. It decreased over time after that, down to 1-2 x 10^28 s^-1 around 40 days post-perihelion (December 8)."}

The main elements of the new model are as follows: a. A primordial, low-mass proto-satellite disk with prograde rotation existed around the proto-Earth. b. Most of the lunar material was ejected from Earth mantle by numerous impacts of large asteroids. This naturally explains the lunar iron deficiency. c. Collisions between ejecta and particles of the prograde proto-satellite disk stabilize the fragments on satellite orbits. We demonstrate the high efficiency of the multi-impact mechanism: ejecta on prograde orbits readily merges with the prograde proto-satellite disk, whereas retrograde ejecta falls back onto Earth."}

This paper analyzes the dynamics of space debris accumulation to identify the primary orbital features contributing to this systemic risk. We compiled and analyzed Two-Line Element (TLE) datasets from Space-Track.org and historical collision data using a Python-based data mining approach. Specifically, we derived satellite velocities using the Vis-Viva equation and evaluated the correlation of five key features, launch piece count, orbital period, apogee, perigee, and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size, with debris density. Our evaluation reveals that apogee and orbital period exhibit the strongest correlation with the risk of the Kessler Syndrome, indicating that satellites in higher orbits pose a disproportionately greater threat to long-term sustainability due to navigational constraints. Contrary to common assumptions, our data suggests that velocity and object size (RCS) show negligible direct correlation with collision incidence in the current dataset. Based on these findings, we propose mitigation strategies focusing on integrating AI-driven autonomous navigation systems and deploying advanced radiation-resistant shielding materials to enhance the resilience of high-orbit assets."}

II: Shot-Noise-Limited Precision via Spectral Factorization", "comment": "Submitted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "We generalize the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) formalism for radial velocity extraction to cases where the underlying spectral components are unknown. The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $τ$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of ~30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to ~50 cm/s with $\\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars."}

The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs."}

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($ε$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites' evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems."}

For each system, we determine stellar masses, orbital parallaxes, effective temperatures, spectral types, semimajor axes, and eccentricities with high precision, resolving discrepancies between astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. Moreover, we assess the potential for stable planetary orbits in these systems. We also calculate habitable zones around these binaries based on the orbital evolution of planetary orbits. These systems may represent promising targets for future extrasolar planet searches around Sun-like stars due to their robust physical and orbital parameters that can be used to determine planetary habitability and stability."}
