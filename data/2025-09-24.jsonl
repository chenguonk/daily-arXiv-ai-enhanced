The SI triggers strong clumping (i.e., strong enough for clumps to\ncollapse) when the solid-to-gas column density ratio, $Z$, exceeds a threshold,\n$\\Zcrit$. This threshold depends on the dimensionless stopping time, $\\tau_s$.\nAlthough the strong-clumping threshold has been explored over the last decade,\nit has been determined largely through 2D axisymmetric simulations. In this\nwork, we perform a suite of 3D, vertically stratified simulations to establish\na clumping threshold across $10^{-3} \\leq \\tau_s \\leq 1.0$. Additionally, we\nstudy SI-driven concentration that is unique to 3D. We find that $\\Zcrit$ is as\nlow as $\\approx 0.002$ at $\\tau_s=0.1$ and exceeds $\\approx 0.03$ at\n$\\tau_s=10^{-3}$. Compared to 2D, our 3D results yield lower $\\Zcrit$ for\n$\\tau_s > 0.02$, but higher for $\\tau_s \\leq 0.02$, with a sharp transition\nbetween $\\tau_s = 0.02$ and 0.03. This transition correlates with midplane\ndensity ratio ($\\epsilon$): $\\epsilon < 1$ where 3D gives lower thresholds, and\n$\\epsilon > 1$ where 3D gives higher thresholds. We also find a\nfilaments-in-filaments structure when $\\epsilon < 1$, which enhances clumping\ncompared to 2D. By contrast, when $\\epsilon > 1$ and $\\tau_s \\leq 0.03$, dust\nfilaments in 3D do not drift inward, suppressing filament mergers and strong\nclumping. In 2D, filaments drift inward regardless of $\\epsilon$, triggering\nstrong clumping easier in this regime. Our results underscore the necessity of\n3D simulations for accurately capturing SI-driven concentration and building\nthe strong-clumping threshold."}

On the metal-poor world W1534, we detect a clear signature of SiH4\ncentered at ~4.55 microns with an abundance of 19+/-2 parts per billion (ppb).\nOur chemical modelling suggests that this SiH4 abundance may be quenched at\n~kilobar levels just above the silicate cloud layers, whereupon vertical\natmospheric mixing can transport SiH4 to the observable photosphere.

Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact\nemissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of\nthe protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN\nemissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions.
