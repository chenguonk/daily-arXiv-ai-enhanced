Our model\nbuilds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda\nand Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous\nparticle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard\nplanet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a\ntandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and\nouter edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The\ninner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When\nplanetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate\noutward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot =\n10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI\nedge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result\nclosely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and\nVenus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong\nsupport for our formation mechanism."}

In addition,\nwe consider not only the ordinal positions but also the specific period ratios\nand radius ratios of planetary pairs in multi-planet systems. We explore\nvarious dependencies on stellar host type and metallicity, as well as planetary\ntypes, and explore the differences between planetary systems with different\nplanet multiplicities and different planetary pairs in the same system.\nFocusing on Kepler systems with two to four planets, we account for\nobservational biases and uncover a robust trend of smaller inner planets. This\ntrend is particularly pronounced in inner pairs of three-planet systems and\nexhibits variations in stellar metallicity and planet multiplicity. Notably, we\nfind that the distribution of inner-to-outer planet radii ratios depends on the\nsystem's metallicity, suggesting a link between initial conditions and the\nresulting system architecture. Interestingly, planet pairs in resonance do not\nexhibit significantly different size ratios compared to non-resonant pairs,\nchallenging current theoretical expectations, again, possibly suggesting that\ninitially resonant systems could have been later destabilized. Our findings\nalign with planet formation and migration models where larger planets form\nfarther out and migrate inward. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of\nplanet ordering as a novel and crucial observable for constraining planet\nformation and evolution models. The observed patterns offer unique insights\ninto the complex interplay of formation, migration, and dynamical interactions\nshaping planetary systems."}

We considered data\ncollected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of\ngeometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To\ncorrect for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we\nadopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the\nplanet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and\ncalibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across\nwavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each\nplanet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we\nsimulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134\nsystems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of\n10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging\ninstruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and\nJupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used\nthe visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color\nreconstructions of each planet.

Main text: 12 pages:\n  Appendix: 4 pages", "summary": "In 2016, Kepler/K2 detected a system of two sub-Neptunes transiting the star\nHD 224018, one of them showing a mono-transit event. In 2017, we began a\nspectroscopic follow-up with HARPS-N to measure the dynamical masses of the\nplanets using radial velocities, and collected additional transit observations\nusing CHEOPS. We measured the fundamental physical parameters of the host star,\nwhich is an ``old Sun'' analogue. We analysed radial velocities and photometric\ntime series, also including data by TESS, to provide precise ephemerides,\nradii, masses, and bulk densities of the two planets, and possibly modeling\ntheir internal structure and composition. The system turned out to be more\ncrowded than shown by K2. Radial velocities revealed the presence of two\nadditional bodies: a candidate cold companion on an eccentric orbit with a\nminimum mass nearly half that of Jupiter (eccentricity $0.60^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$;\nsemi-major axis 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ au), and an innermost super-Earth (orbital\nperiod 10.6413$\\pm$0.0028 d; mass 4.1$\\pm$0.8 Me) for which we discovered\npreviously undetected transit events in K2 photometry. TESS revealed a second\ntransit of one of the two companions originally observed by K2. This allowed us\nto constrain its orbital period to a grid of values, the most likely being\n$\\sim$138 days, which would imply a mass less than 9 Me, at a 3$\\sigma$\nsignificance level. Given the level of precision of our measurements, we were\nable to constrain the internal structure and composition of the second-most\ndistant planet from the host star, a warm sub-Neptune with a bulk density of\n3.9$\\pm$0.5 g/cm$^{3}$. HD 224018 hosts three close-in transiting planets in\nthe super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune regime, and a candidate cold and eccentric\nmassive companion. Additional follow-up is needed to better characterise the\nphysical properties of the planets and their architecture."}

We aim to characterize the horizontal and vertical\nvariability of hydrocarbon absorption in Jupiter's auroral atmosphere using\nultraviolet data from the Juno-UVS spectrograph and to investigate potential\ndepartures from the expected structure. We constructed color ratio maps\nsensitive to CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions for perijoves (PJs) 6 and 10,\ntwo of Juno's close approaches to Jupiter, by integrating auroral H$_2$\nemission over hydrocarbon-sensitive spectral intervals. For CH$_4$, we\nredefined the absorbed spectral band, replacing the traditionally used 125-130\nnm interval with 135-140 nm, in order to mitigate higher-order calibration\nissues. In regions of intense auroral brightness, we developed a correction\nmethod to account for spectral distortion due to detector non-linearities at\nhigh fluxes. CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions generally follow the expected\nvertical distribution, with the CH$_4$ density extending to higher altitudes\nthan C$_2$H$_2$. However, several localized regions show unexpected spatial\ndistribution of the absorption. In PJ6, such anomalies are attributed to\ninstrumental non-linearities. After correction, the CR distributions become\nconsistent with standard hydrocarbon vertical distributions. In PJ10, however,\nsome anomalous patterns persist despite correction. Spectral modeling indicates\nthat these can be explained by modifying the relative abundances of CH$_4$ and\nC$_2$H$_2$, suggesting horizontal compositional variability and possible\ndeviations in homopause altitude between species. These findings underscore the\nimportance of accounting for local atmospheric composition when interpreting\nultraviolet auroral spectra and retrieving electron energy distributions."}

Assuming\nthat the Kamoi crater was formed by a recent impact, we conducted\nthree-dimensional seismic wave propagation simulations and applied a simplified\nlandslide model to estimate surface accelerations and boulder displacements.\nOur results show that even a low-energy case (1 % of the nominal seismic\nenergy) produces surface accelerations sufficient to destabilize the surface\nmaterials. The simulated boulder displacements are consistent with the observed\ndistribution of space weathering degrees even on the opposite hemisphere.
