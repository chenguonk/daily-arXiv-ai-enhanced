Appearing as Chapter 7 of the book Centaurs", "summary": "Centaurs populate relatively short-lived and rapidly evolving orbits in the giant-planet region and are believed to be one of the solar system's most complex and diverse populations. Most Centaurs are linked to origins in the dynamically excited component of the trans-Neptunian region, and are often considered an intermediate phase in the evolution of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Additionally, the Centaur region hosts objects from varied source populations and having different dynamical histories. In this chapter, we focus on the physical processes responsible for the evolution of this heterogeneous population in the giant-planet region. The chapter begins with a brief review on the origin and early evolution that determine Centaurs' properties prior to entering the giant-planet region. Next, we discuss the thermal, collisional, and tidal processes believed to drive the changes Centaurs undergo. We provide a comprehensive review of the evidence for evolutionary changes derived from studies of the activity, physical properties, and surface characteristics of Centaurs and related populations, such as trans-Neptunian objects, JFCs, and Trojans. This chapter reveals a multitude of gaps in the current understanding of the evolution mechanisms acting in the giant-planet region. In light of these open questions, we conclude with an outlook on future telescope and spacecraft observations, detailing how they are expected to elucidate Centaur evolution processes."}

We present a detailed analysis of both objects using high-resolution ($R \\sim 35,000$) $K$ band spectroscopy from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combined with archival photometry. With a mass of $30^{+5}_{-4} M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ (planet-to-host mass ratio 0.05) and projected separation of $67\\pm4$ AU from its host, CD-35 2722 B likely formed via gravitational instability.

The chemical compositions for the brown dwarf and host star agree within the $1.5σ$ level, supporting a scenario where CD-35 2722 B formed via gravitational instability. We do not find evidence for clouds on CD-35 2722 B despite it being a photometrically red mid-L dwarf and thus expected to be quite cloudy. We retrieve a temperature structure which is more isothermal than models and investigate its impact on our measurements, finding that constraining the temperature structure to self-consistent models does not significantly impact our retrieved chemical properties. Our observations highlight the need for data from complementary wavelength ranges to verify the presence of aerosols in likely cloudy L dwarfs."}

However, stellar variability can have major consequences for the evolution of planetary climates. In this work, we evaluate how stellar variability influences the equilibrium temperature and water retention of planets within the Habitable Zone (HZ). We present a sample of 9 stars that are known to host at least one planet within the HZ and that were identified to have a variability amplitude exceeding 100 ppm based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We investigate the effect that the variability of these stars have on the insolation flux of their HZ planets and the resulting changes in the induced planetary equilibrium temperature. Our results show that for the stars in our sample, the stellar variability has an insignificant effect on the equilibrium temperature of HZ planets. However, we also emphasize that these stars are not representative of more extreme variable stars, since exoplanets are more difficult to detect and characterize in the presence of extreme variability. We also investigate the equilibrium temperature and long-term evolution of a hypothetical Earth-like planet placed at the inner edge of the HZ around a highly variable star. We found that the water loss rates are comparable between both variable and quiet host stars for Earth-like planets in the inner HZ. Overall, these results broaden our knowledge on the impact of stellar variability on planetary habitability."}

Daily monitoring by the LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project revealed a major activity increase between November 2 and 4, accompanied by rapid changes in coma morphology. Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back-extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment A in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption."}

However, the photochemistry governing [O I] release into the coma is not well understood, and using theoretical release rates often yields different results than using empirical release rates determined in conjunction with direct space-based measurements of CO$_2$. We hypothesize that the accuracy of the release rates could depend on the level of solar activity at the time the comet is observed, which will be influenced by the solar cycle. We present observations and analysis of [O I] emission in one comet observed near solar maximum, C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), and one near solar minimum, C/2007 N3 (Lulin). Our [O I] measurements were obtained using two high spectral resolution optical spectrographs: the Tull Coudè spectrometer at McDonald Observatory and the ARCES spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We use empirical and theoretical models for [O I] emission from the literature to derive multiple sets of inferred CO$_2$ abundances for these comets and compare to contemporaneous space-based measurements of CO$_2$. We find that the empirical model, which was developed based on comet observations obtained near solar maximum, reproduces the directly measured CO$_2$ abundances better for Lovejoy. Neither model accurately reproduces the direct measurement for Lulin. We discuss the implications of our findings for the accuracy and dependencies of the oxygen line ratio method for inferring CO$_2$ abundances in cometary comae."}

In this study, we comparatively examine the seasonal behaviour of vertical distribution of meteor occurrence height and decay time height at two identical radars of conjugate polar latitudes, Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and Rothera (68$^\\circ$S). In order to understand the nature of meteor trail variations, the received signal power is categorised into two groups as weak and strong echoes, and their seasonal mean vertical profiles are constructed. It has been noticed that the meteor occurrence height shown a seasonal symmetry, however, decay time vertical profiles shows an asymmetric pattern at conjugate polar latitudes, particularly for strong echoes. Seasonally, there is about 1 km difference in occurrence height and decay time height of weak and strong echoes. From the decay time vertical profiles, it has been noticed that the decay time turning altitude (i.e., inflection point) varies seasonally in the altitudes range of 80-86 km for weak and strong echoes. The maximum turning altitude of about 85 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\\circ$S), similarly minimum turning altitude of about 80 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\\circ$S). The probable reasons for such behaviour of meteor trails at opposite polar latitudes are discussed."}

Head"], "title": "Tidal Heating of the Lunar Magma Ocean", "comment": "Submitted to Science (2025). 37 pages, 5 main figures. Supplementary Materials include 4 supplementary figures and 1 supplementary table", "summary": "The timing of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification is governed by its thermal evolution. A key geochronological observation is that all analyzed products of LMO solidification have ages (or age peaks) near 4.35 +/- 0.05 billion years ago (Ga), suggesting rapid solidification of the last ~40% of the LMO at that time. The ages raise two questions: (1) how was the final solidification of the LMO delayed for over 100 Myr (million years) from the Moon's formation, and (2) after such a delay, how did it solidify so quickly? These two aspects of the ages are inconsistent with models of early-fast solidification or slow-prolonged solidification, controlled by radiogenic heat production and convective cooling (even if slowed by a conductive lithosphere). We propose that both aspects can not only be explained by tidal heating of the LMO but are in fact robust and expected thermal evolution features of a magma ocean cooling while being tidally heated and, in the Moon's case, receding from the Earth. The delay in solidification is due to the LMO being trapped at a stable equilibrium between the enhanced tidal heating rate and the decreasing cooling rate. The rapid solidification at ~4.35 Ga occurs when the Moon retreats to the point where an unstable equilibrium is reached, where tidal heating is drastically reduced, rapidly cooling the Moon. Moreover, an unanticipated outcome of our modeling is that the farside of the Moon is predicted to be 20-60 deg C cooler than the nearside for ~10-100 Myr during the final solidification stage. This is consistent with previous studies indicating asymmetric crystallization of the LMO from the farside to the nearside, which leads to an older and less evolved farside crust than the nearside, consistent with the observed higher Mg# of farside anorthositic crust and the nearside concentration of H2O, KREEP, and high Fe-Ti components."}

The system was recently identified as a candidate two-planet system in a machine-learning search of the TESS light curves. Using TESS data and photometric follow-up observations with ASTEP, CHEOPS, and EulerCam, we show that one transit was initially misattributed and that the system consists of three transiting giant planets with orbital periods of 11.5, 22.6, and 48.9 days. The planets have radii of 0.65, 0.96, and 0.94 R_J, making them the largest known trio of transiting planets. The system architecture lies near a 4:2:1 mean motion resonant chain, inducing large transit timing variations for all three planets. Photodynamical modeling gives mass estimates of 0.057, 0.41, and 0.60 M_J and favors low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. TOI-7510 is an interesting system for investigating the dynamical interactions and formation histories of compact systems of giant planets."}

This study presents the first application of high-precision astrometry to search for exomoons around substellar companions. We investigate whether the orbital motion of the companion HD 206893 B exhibits astrometric residuals consistent with the gravitational influence of an exomoon or binary planet. Using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, we monitored the astrometric positions of HD 206893 B and c across both short (days to months) and long (yearly) timescales. This enabled us to isolate potential residual wobbles in the motion of component B attributable to an orbiting moon. Our analysis reveals tentative astrometric residuals in the HD 206893 B orbit. If interpreted as an exomoon signature, these residuals correspond to a candidate (HD 206893 B I) with an orbital period of approximately 0.76 years and a mass of $\\sim$0.4 Jupiter masses. However, the origin of these residuals remains ambiguous and could be due to systematics. Complementing the astrometry, our analysis of GRAVITY $R=4000$ spectroscopy for HD 206893 B confirms a clear detection of water, but no CO is found using cross-correlation. We also find that AF Lep b, and $β$ Pic b are the best short-term candidates to look for moons with GRAVITY+. Our observations demonstrate the transformative potential of high-precision astrometry in the search for exomoons, and proves the feasibility of the technique to detect moons with masses lower than Jupiter and potentially down to less than Neptune in optimistic cases. Crucially, further high-precision astrometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY are essential to verify the reality and nature of this signal and attempt this technique on a variety of planetary systems."}

Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of ten self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to in eight of the ten scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrow-band directed transmissions, which occurs in two of the scenarios. Further study by direct detection at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combination of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture.

It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet from the Oort Cloud, as these comets have fleeting visits to the inner Solar System lasting only months to years from first discovery, too short for the usual process of mission development to be followed. In this paper we describe a number of factors that need to be considered in selecting a target for the mission, including scientific, orbital, spacecraft and instrument constraints, and discussion of different prioritisation strategies. We find that, in the case where we have a choice of targets, our decisions will mostly be driven by orbital information, which we will have relatively early on, with information on the activity level of the comet an important but secondary consideration. As cometary activity levels are notoriously hard to predict based on early observations alone, this prioritisation / decision approach based more on orbits gives us confidence that a good comet that is compatible with the spacecraft constraints will be selectable with sufficient warning time to allow the mission to intercept it."}
