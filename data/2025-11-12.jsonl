(2011) as a visual overdensity of objects with low ecliptic inclinations and eccentricities at semimajor axes near 44 AU. This raises the question - are there other structures present in the classical Kuiper belt? If there are, clustering algorithms applied to orbits transformed into free elements may yield the best chance of discovery. Here, we derive barycentric free orbital elements for objects in the classical Kuiper belt, and use the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to identify a new structure, which we dub the inner kernel, located at $a \\sim 43 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$ just inward of the kernel ($a \\sim 44 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$), which we also recover. It is yet unclear whether the inner kernel is an extension of the kernel or a distinct structure. Forthcoming observations, including those by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) may provide further evidence for the existence of this structure, and perhaps resolve the question of whether there are two distinct structures."}

In this paper we fit the stellar spectral energy distributions of exoplanet hosts to measure their radii, making use of only archival photometry, the $Gaia$ parallaxes and $Gaia$ extinction maps. Using the extinction maps frees us of the degeneracy between temperature and extinction which has plagued this method in the past. The resulting radii have typical random uncertainties of about 2 per cent. We perform a quantitative study of systematic uncertainties affecting the methodology and find they are similar to, or smaller than, the random ones. We discuss how the stellar parameters can be used to derive the properties of both transiting exoplanets, and those where only a radial-velocity curve is available. We then explore in detail the improvements the method makes possible for the parameters of the PanCET sample of transiting planets. For this sample we find the best literature measurements of the planetary radii have mean uncertainties about 40 per cent larger than those presented here, with the new measurements achieving precisions of 2 per cent in radius and 10 per cent in mass. In contrast to much recent work, these transiting exoplanets parameters are derived without using theoretical models of stellar interiors, freeing them of the assumptions those models contain, and any priors for stellar age. As the data used are available for the whole sky, the method can be used for self-consistent measurements of the planetary parameters of a very large fraction of known exoplanets."}

A proposed subset, Hycean planets, would have liquid water oceans and be potentially habitable, but there are many unanswered questions about their atmospheric dynamics and 3D climate states. To explore such climates in detail, we report a General Circulation Model (GCM) for Hycean worlds, building on a modified version of the ExoCAM GCM. Considering the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a Hycean candidate, we implement GCMs with different surface pressures and albedos. We find dynamical structures similar to those of tidally-locked terrestrial planets as `slow rotators' with either one equatorial or twin mid-latitude zonal jets. We see moist convective inhibition that matches high resolution models, although in hotter cases the inhibited zone is subsaturated. When imposing a top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) Bond albedo ($A_b$) by modifying the incident stellar flux, we find that the threshold for K2-18~b to not enter a runaway greenhouse state is $A_b \\geq 0.55$ for a 1 bar atmosphere, consistent with previous studies, and $A_b \\geq 0.8$ for a 5 bar atmosphere. However, a more realistic treatment of the albedo, by modelling scattering within the atmosphere using an enhanced Rayleigh parametrisation, leads to lower lapse rates and stronger thermal inversions. We find that 1 bar atmospheres are stable for an albedo of $A_b \\geq 0.27$, 5 bar atmospheres for $A_b \\geq 0.35$, and 10 bar atmospheres for $A_b \\geq 0.48$. Moderate albedos such as these are typical of the solar system planets and the required scattering is consistent with observational constraints for K2-18~b, supporting its plausibility as a Hycean world."}

High-contrast coronagraphic imaging was performed using JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. After subtracting the disk contribution through forward modeling by means of synthetic PSFs and MCMC optimizations, the residuals were analyzed to identify candidate point sources. From these, we derived contrast curves and constructed detection probability maps for substellar companions. The disk is clearly detected in both NIRCam filters and reveals a broad, inclined structure with a gap, consistent with previous scattered-light and ALMA observations. The modeling confirms the presence of a gap at ~80 au and shows a scale height and scattering properties compatible with a dynamically active disk. A significant brightness asymmetry is observed in the southwestern inner ring at both 2 and 4.4 μm, consistent with previous ALMA results. Observing this feature across different wavelengths and epochs strongly supports a scenario where one or more unseen planetary companions are perturbing the disk. No comoving sources are detected, and all candidate objects in the field are consistent with background stars or galaxies. The derived detection limits exclude planets more massive than ~0.4-0.5 MJ beyond 100 au and more massive than ~1 MJ beyond 20-40 au. This, in turn, rules out the possibility of a single planet placed beyond ~20 au as responsible for the astrometric signal observed by Gaia. These results, combined with the observed disk features, support a scenario in which a single or multiple sub-Jupiter planets dynamically shape the system through mechanisms such as secular apsidal resonances, providing a coherent explanation for the gap, the asymmetric brightness distribution and the astrometric signal."}

This stellar class is also the most frequent host of molecular gas in systems older than typical protoplanetary disc lifetimes, and the most likely to host detected giant planets in radial-velocity surveys. The debris discs of intermediate-mass stars have therefore become fertile ground for studying disc-planet interactions. In this work, we present the first ALMA observations toward the A-type star HD 126062, located in Upper Centaurus Lupus / Lower Centaurus Crux, with the aim of characterising its debris disc. We probed the thermal continuum emission using observations at 1.3 mm, analysed through image reconstruction under different visibility-weighting regimes and parametric model fitting to the observed visibilities. The setup also covered the frequency of the 12CO(2-1) line, allowing imaging of gas near the system. We detected dust continuum emission from an exo-Kuiper belt around HD 126062. Modelled as a Gaussian ring, the visibilities are consistent with a radial separation R = 2.01'' (+0.04, -0.05), equivalent to ~270 (+5, -4) au, and a full width at half maximum DeltaR = 0.71'' +- 0.09 (95 +- 12 au). The continuum emission appears nearly face-on, with inclination <=17 deg. 12CO(2-1) emission is detected in the vicinity of the debris disc, with most of it located external to the exo-Kuiper belt. The exo-Kuiper belt characterised here is among the largest yet detected and agrees with previous predictions of the dust distribution based on spectral energy distribution fitting. The morphology and velocity offset relative to the systemic velocity suggest that the gas is not associated with the star or disc, but likely originates from a diffuse cloud in the nearby galaxy."}

However, these atmospheres may also be polluted via solid accretion or ice sublimation in the disk. Here, we propose a novel mechanism for enriching the atmospheres of these giant planets with volatiles via pebble drift, fragmentation, and ice sublimation. We use a combination of 3D hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer, and particle tracking to follow the trajectories and resulting temperatures of solids in a disk containing an embedded planet forming outside the CO snowline. We show that small dust can become entrained in the meridional flows created by the giant planet and advected above the disk midplane where temperatures are well above the sublimation temperature of CO. This transport of small grains occurs over 10 kyr timescales, with individual micron-sized grains cycling between the midplane and surface of the disk multiple times throughout the planetary accretion stage. We find that this stirring of dust results in sublimation of CO gas above the snow surface in the dust trap created exterior to the giant planet, leading to super-solar CO abundances in the pressure bump. This mechanism of Dust Recycling and Icy Volatile Enrichment in cold giant planets, which we call the DRIVE effect, may explain enhanced metallicities of both wide separation exoplanets as well as Jupiter in our own Solar System."}

We describe the design and early implementation of a survey to test whether planets also exist orbiting the remnant stars of ancient dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way, and if so, how they differ from their Milky Way counterparts. VOYAGERS (Views Of Yore - Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey) is a radial velocity (RV) search using precision spectrographs to discover exoplanets orbiting very low metallicity ($-2.8 < [\\mathrm{Fe/H}] \\leq -0.8$) stars born in the dwarf galaxy Enceladus, which merged with the Milky Way galaxy about 10 Gyr ago. A sample of 22 candidates have been screened from a catalog of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) members using a combination of stellar properties and reconnaissance observations from the TRES spectrograph. Precision RV measurements have been initiated using the NEID, HARPS-N, and CARMENES spectrographs. We plan to focus most upcoming observations on 10 main sequence targets. Data collection is well underway, with 778 observations on 22 candidates (385 of which are 10 focus targets), but far from complete. This survey is designed to be sensitive to sub-Neptune mass planets with periods up to hundreds of days. We note that the RV analysis gives mass multiplied by $\\sin (inclination)$ or the minimum mass for exoplanets. The expected survey yield is three planets, assuming that occurrence rates are similar to those in the Milky Way and taking into account the degeneracy with inclination in our yield models. Our survey is designed to detect at least one exoplanet if occurrence rates are similar to known Milky Way exoplanets or, if no exoplanets are discovered, to rule out a Milky Way-like planet population in GES with 95% confidence level."}

We present a generalization of the classical isothermal, isobaric transmission model by allowing the opacity to vary with pressure as a power law, $κ\\propto P^{n}$, and explicitly defining the reference opacity $κ_{0}$ at a chosen pressure $P_{0}$. By treating the slant optical depth as an Abel transform of the radial absorption coefficient, we derive a closed-form expression for the effective transit radius in a hydrostatic, isothermal atmosphere with pressure-dependent opacity. The solution provides a compact framework for exploring non-isobaric effects and explicitly links the vertical opacity gradient to observable spectral features. We benchmark the model against empirical transmission spectra of Earth and the hot Jupiter WASP-39b, finding a significantly improved fit relative to the isobaric formula. This generalized expression offers a physically interpretable foundation for analyzing high-precision spectra from JWST and upcoming ARIEL observations, and can serve as a basis for semi-analytical retrieval approaches optimized for computational efficiency."}

Their anomalously-inflated radii, along with recent JWST atmospheric observations, suggest a source of internal heating. Because these planets are nominally too cool to be affected by the hot Jupiter inflation mechanism, dissipation of eccentricity tides within the planet has been proposed as a leading explanation for the source of this heat flux. Using the MAROON-X spectrograph on Gemini-North, we conducted a high-precision radial-velocity campaign to precisely measure the eccentricities of three of these popcorn planets: WASP-107 b, TOI-1173 b, and HAT-P-18 b. We constrained their eccentricities below $e < 0.03$--$0.05$ to 95% confidence, decisively ruling out active heating from eccentricity tides as the cause of these planets' inflated radii (except for the unlikely scenario in which their tidal quality factors are less than the Earth's). An alternative heating mechanism is likely responsible for inflating these planets. Our measurements also provide new constraints on $e\\cosω$, significantly shrinking the eclipse timing uncertainties to better than $\\pm2.5$ hr and allowing for confident scheduling of thermal emission measurements for these enigmatic planets."}

Investigating the origins of iron-rich planetesimals could provide key insights into planet formation mechanisms. Using differentiation models, we evaluate the interior structure and composition of representative-sized planetesimals (approx. 200 km diameter) while varying oxygen fugacity and initial bulk meteoritic composition. Under the oxygen-poor conditions that likely existed early in the inner regions of the Solar System and other protoplanetary disks, core fractions remain relatively consistent across a range of bulk compositions (CI, H, EH, and CBa). Some of these cores could incorporate significant amounts of silicon (10-30 wt percent) and explain the metal fractions of Fe-rich bodies in the absence of mantle stripping. Conversely, planetesimals forming under more oxidizing conditions, such as beyond snow lines, could exhibit smaller cores enriched in carbon, sulfur (more than 1 wt percent), and oxides. Sulfur-rich cores, like those formed from EH and H bulk compositions, could remain partly molten, sustain dynamos, and even drive sulfur-rich volcanism. Additionally, bodies with high carbon contents, such as CI compositions, can form graphitic outer layers. These variations highlight the importance of initial formation conditions in shaping planetesimal structures. Future missions, such as NASA's Psyche mission, offer an opportunity to measure the relative abundances of key elements (Fe, Ni, Si, and S) necessary to distinguish among formation scenarios and structure models for Fe-rich and reduced planetesimals."}

Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations show that hot dust close to the protostar and in the line of sight to the observer, either in the uppermost disk layers of a strongly flared disk or in a dusty envelope, is necessary to model the observations. The shadow cast by a dense innermost disk midplane on the dust further out explains the observed closure phases in the L band and to some extent in the M band.

A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian."}

This bright G-type star ($M_{\\ast}$: 0.99 $\\text{M}_{\\odot}$; $R_{\\ast}$: 1.13 $\\text{R}_{\\odot}$; age: 7.4 Gyr; V mag: 8.25) hosts a transiting sub-Neptune, HD 85426 b, with an orbital period of 16.71 days and a blackbody equilibrium temperature of $824^{+11}_{-11}$ K. By jointly analysing HARPS-N RVs, TESS, and CHEOPS photometric data and using two different stellar activity mitigation techniques, we constrain planet b's mass to $6.0^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$ and $8.5^{+1.3}_{-1.4} $ $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$, depending on the mitigation technique. We investigate the dependence of these results on the priors, data selection, and inclusion of other Keplerians in the modelling. Using this approach, we identify the presence of two non-transiting planetary companions with minimum masses near 10 $\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$ and orbital periods of 35.7 and 89 days. Additionally, we reject the initial hypothesis that the 35.7-day periodic signal was due to stellar activity. We also determine HD 85426 b's radius to be $2.78^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ $\\text{R}_{\\oplus}$ and compute a transmission spectroscopy metric in the range of 82 to 115, making this planet a highly valuable target for atmospheric characterisation."}

Turyshev"], "title": "Lunar Dust: Formation, Microphysics, and Transport", "comment": "22 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "Lunar dust -- the sub-millimeter fraction of the regolith -- controls the optical, thermophysical, electrical, mechanical, and environmental behavior of the Moon's surface. These properties set the performance envelopes of remote-sensing retrievals, regolith geotechnics, volatile cycles, and exploration systems, while also posing operational and biomedical risks. We synthesize Apollo sample analyses and in-situ observations (Surveyor, Lunokhod, Apollo) with contemporary datasets from the LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer, the LADEE/LDEX exospheric dust measurements, and Chang'e-4 Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR). We also incorporate 2024-2025 results: Chandrayaan-3 ChaSTE thermophysics at the Vikram lander's site, SCALPSS plume-surface diagnostics from Intuitive Machines Mission 1 (IM-1), and Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) detections of a dayside near-surface H$^{-}$ population on Chang'e-6. The review links (i) production and modification processes to (ii) grain-scale physical/chemical/electrical/optical/mechanical properties, then to (iii) mobilization pathways (meteoroid ejecta, electrostatic hopping, rocket-plume entrainment), and finally to (iv) region-specific design ranges across maria, highlands, pyroclastic units, magnetic swirls, and permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). We quantify temperature-illumination dependence across day/night and PSR-equator regimes through a two-channel $k(T,ρ)$ model and charge-relaxation scaling. We provide closed-form expressions for adhesion-aware lift thresholds and for near-surface (0-3~m) dust transport at apex/hover heights as functions of sheath structure. The result is a design-ready set of relations, figures, and tables that propagate microphysics and composition into engineering parameters for upcoming landed and rover operations."}
