After the protoplanetary disc dissipates, the rapidly rotating\nplanet may eject a decretion (outflowing) disc in a similar way to a Be star.\nBoundary layer effects in a hydrodynamic disc allow for decretion disc\nformation at spin rates below the breakup spin rate of the planet. The\ndecretion disc exerts a torque on the planet that slows its spin to an\nequilibrium value that is sensitive to the planet temperature. By considering\nsteady state circumplanetary decretion disc solutions, we show that the\nequilibrium spin rate for planets is around $0.4\\,\\Omega_{\\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.2$\nand around $0.2\\,\\Omega_{\\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.3$, where $H$ is the disc scale\nheight at radius $R$. These values are in line with the spins of the giant\nplanets in the solar system and observed exoplanet spins."}

The\ncoexistence of these two buoyancy sources gives rise to double-diffusive\nconvection (DDC) due to the contrast between thermal and compositional\ndiffusivities. However, most dynamo simulations adopt the co-density model,\nwhere the two diffusivities are assumed to be equal. In this study, we\nperformed both hydrodynamic and dynamo simulations of top-heavy DDC in a\nrotating spherical shell with the Lewis number $Le=100$, and compared them with\ncorresponding co-density models. In the hydrodynamic regime, the convective\nflow morphology is strongly influenced by the nature of the buoyancy sources.\nHowever, our dynamo simulations in the strong-field regime demonstrate that the\nco-density and DDC models yield qualitatively similar magnetic fields at\ncomparable magnetic Reynolds numbers, albeit with some differences in detail.\nThese numerical models further justify the use of the co-density model in\nplanetary dynamo simulations. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamo models based\non DDC and co-density produce similar magnetic fields and secular variations at\nthe core-mantle boundary. This suggests that it may not be possible to\ndistinguish the buoyancy sources responsible for planetary dynamos based solely\non magnetic field observations."}

The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to\ndistinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines),\nand mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can\nnow probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in\ngas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far,\nALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and\nO-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like\nstars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting\ngas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with\nformation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is\nemerging an arguably \"conventional\" picture of gas-giant planet formation for\ntransiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data."}

We investigate the performance of\nfour supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive\nset of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area\nUnder the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion\nmatrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the\nhighest accuracy (99.8\\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior\ngeneralization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\\%\naccuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\\%\naccuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and\ngeneralization at 95.8\\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority\nOver-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all\nmodels by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the\neffectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly\nRandom Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated\nexoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for\nimplementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National\nObservatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further\nadvance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts."}
