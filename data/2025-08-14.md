TL;DR: 论文研究了原行星盘物质吸积对巨行星自转的影响，发现行星在吸积过程中会快速旋转至接近破裂速率，随后通过形成外流盘减缓自转，最终达到平衡自转速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨巨行星在形成过程中自转速率的演化机制，并与太阳系和系外行星的观测结果进行对比。

Method: 通过稳态环绕行星的外流盘模型，分析行星自转速率与盘参数（如尺度高度）的关系。

Result: 平衡自转速率约为破裂速率的0.4倍（H/R=0.2）和0.2倍（H/R=0.3），与观测结果一致。

Conclusion: 外流盘的扭矩效应是行星自转速率平衡的关键因素，解释了太阳系和系外巨行星的自转现象。

Abstract: Accretion of material from a protoplanetary disc on to a forming giant planet
can spin the planet up to close to its breakup rate, $\Omega_{\rm b}=(G M_{\rm
p}/R_{\rm p}^3)$, where $M_{\rm p}$ is the mass and $R_{\rm p}$ is the radius
of the planet. After the protoplanetary disc dissipates, the rapidly rotating
planet may eject a decretion (outflowing) disc in a similar way to a Be star.
Boundary layer effects in a hydrodynamic disc allow for decretion disc
formation at spin rates below the breakup spin rate of the planet. The
decretion disc exerts a torque on the planet that slows its spin to an
equilibrium value that is sensitive to the planet temperature. By considering
steady state circumplanetary decretion disc solutions, we show that the
equilibrium spin rate for planets is around $0.4\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.2$
and around $0.2\,\Omega_{\rm b}$ for $H/R=0.3$, where $H$ is the disc scale
height at radius $R$. These values are in line with the spins of the giant
planets in the solar system and observed exoplanet spins.

### [2] [Dynamos driven by top-heavy double-diffusive convection in the strong-field regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09410)
*Wei Fan,Yufeng Lin*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过旋转球壳中的双扩散对流（DDC）和共密度模型模拟，发现两者在强磁场区域产生的磁场定性相似，验证了共密度模型在行星发电机模拟中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨双扩散对流（DDC）与共密度模型在行星发电机模拟中的差异，验证共密度模型的合理性。

Method: 在旋转球壳中进行流体动力学和发电机模拟，对比DDC（Lewis数=100）与共密度模型的结果。

Result: DDC和共密度模型在强磁场区域产生相似的磁场和地核-地幔边界的长期变化。

Conclusion: 共密度模型在行星发电机模拟中适用，仅通过磁场观测无法区分驱动行星发电机的浮力源。

Abstract: The magnetic fields of terrestrial planets are generated in their liquid
cores through dynamo action driven by thermal and compositional convection. The
coexistence of these two buoyancy sources gives rise to double-diffusive
convection (DDC) due to the contrast between thermal and compositional
diffusivities. However, most dynamo simulations adopt the co-density model,
where the two diffusivities are assumed to be equal. In this study, we
performed both hydrodynamic and dynamo simulations of top-heavy DDC in a
rotating spherical shell with the Lewis number $Le=100$, and compared them with
corresponding co-density models. In the hydrodynamic regime, the convective
flow morphology is strongly influenced by the nature of the buoyancy sources.
However, our dynamo simulations in the strong-field regime demonstrate that the
co-density and DDC models yield qualitatively similar magnetic fields at
comparable magnetic Reynolds numbers, albeit with some differences in detail.
These numerical models further justify the use of the co-density model in
planetary dynamo simulations. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamo models based
on DDC and co-density produce similar magnetic fields and secular variations at
the core-mantle boundary. This suggests that it may not be possible to
distinguish the buoyancy sources responsible for planetary dynamos based solely
on magnetic field observations.

TL;DR: 对热木星HD 189733 b的高分辨率K和L波段观测进行了联合分析，约束了其大气压力-温度剖面和化学成分，发现其氧丰富且挥发性金属丰度接近太阳值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过多波段地面高分辨率光谱精确限制系外行星大气中微量物种的丰度，验证其形成机制。

Method: 使用KPIC观测数据，结合大气反演管道（基于petit）进行联合分析。

Result: HD 189733 b的大气氧丰富（C/O < 10^-3），挥发性金属丰度接近太阳值，H2O混合比下限为log H2O_VMR > -3.1，并限制了CO、CH4、NH3、H2S和HCN的混合比上限。

Conclusion: 低C/O和中等金属丰度的组成支持其形成过程中晚期吸积大量富氧固体或冰的假设。

Abstract: We present a joint analysis of high-resolution $K$- and $L$-band observations
of the benchmark hot Jupiter \hdb\ from the Keck Planet Imager and
Characterizer (KPIC). One half night of observations were obtained in each
bandpass covering similar pre-eclipse phases. The two epochs were then jointly
analyzed using our atmospheric retrieval pipeline based on \petit\ to constrain
the atmospheric pressure-temperature profile and chemical composition.
Consistent with recent results from \textit{JWST} observations at lower
spectral resolution, we obtain an oxygen-rich composition for \hdb\ ($\rm C/O <
10^{-3}$ at 95\% confidence) and a lower limit on the volatile metallicity
similar to the solar value ($\rm [(C+O)/H] > -0.2$ at 95\% confidence).
Leveraging the large spectral grasp of the multi-band observations, we
constrain the H$_2$O mixing ratio to $\rm \log H_2O_{VMR} > -3.1$ at 95\%
confidence, and obtain 95\% upper limits on the atmospheric mixing ratios of CO
($<10^{-4.8}$), CH$_4$ ($<10^{-4.5}$), NH$_3$ ($<10^{-5.8}$), H$_2$S
($<10^{-3.3}$), and HCN ($<10^{-5.6}$). The limits on CH$_4$, NH$_3$, and HCN
are consistent with recent results from \textit{JWST} transmission
spectroscopy, demonstrating the value of multi-band ground-based high
resolution spectroscopy for precisely constraining trace species abundances in
exoplanet atmospheres. The retrieved low-C/O, moderate-metallicity composition
for \hdb\ is consistent with formation scenarios involving late accretion of
substantial quantities of oxygen-rich refractory solids and/or ices.

### [4] [Linking planet formation to exoplanet characteristics: C/O as a diagnostic of planet formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09587)
*Catherine Walsh*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了气态巨行星的大气成分作为行星形成理论的测试案例，重点关注金属丰度和C/O比，以区分形成位置和机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究气态巨行星的大气成分，以验证其形成理论，包括形成位置（如雪线附近）和机制（如核心吸积与引力不稳定）。

Method: 利用ALMA和JWST观测数据，分析行星形成区域和行星大气的成分。

Result: 外盘区域通常贫金属和贫氧，而内盘区域富氧；大多数气态巨行星金属富集且富氧，支持其在雪线附近形成并被冰体污染的观点。

Conclusion: 目前数据支持气态巨行星在雪线附近形成的“常规”理论，但需未来数据进一步验证。

Abstract: Gas-giant exoplanets are test cases for theories of planet formation as their
atmospheres are proposed to carry signatures of their formation within the
protoplanetary disk. The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to
distinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines),
and mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can
now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in
gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far,
ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and
O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like
stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting
gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with
formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is
emerging an arguably "conventional" picture of gas-giant planet formation for
transiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于从开普勒太空望远镜的光度数据中识别系外行星，比较了四种分类算法的性能，其中随机森林表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系外行星的发现扩展了我们对行星系统的理解，但需要高效的方法处理大量光度数据以识别系外行星。

Method: 使用四种监督分类算法（随机森林、KNN、决策树和逻辑回归）分析3,198个光度测量数据，并采用SMOTE技术解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 随机森林表现最优（准确率99.8%），KNN次之（99.3%），决策树和逻辑回归分别达到97.1%和95.8%。SMOTE显著提升了所有模型的性能。

Conclusion: 基于集成学习的机器学习方法（尤其是随机森林）在处理光度数据时表现出色，有望在地面天文台（如伊朗国家天文台）中推广应用。

Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary
systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we
present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a
time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising
3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of
four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive
set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion
matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the
highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior
generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\%
accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\%
accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and
generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all
models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly
Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated
exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for
implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National
Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further
advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.
