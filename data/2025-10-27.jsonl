APJ accepted", "summary": "Vertical mixing disrupts the thermochemical equilibrium and introduces\nadditional heat flux that alters exoplanetary atmospheric temperatures. We\ninvestigate how this mixing-induced heat flux affects atmospheric chemistry.\nTemperature increase in the lower atmosphere by the mixing-induced heat flux\nalters species abundances there and modifies those in the upper atmosphere\nthrough vertical transport. In the lower atmosphere, most species follow\nthermodynamic equilibrium with temperature changes. In the upper layers,\nspecies mixing ratios depend on the positions of quenching levels relative to\nthe regions exhibiting significant mixing-induced temperature variations. When\nthe quenching level resides within such region (e.g. CO, $\\rm CH_4$, and $\\rm\nH_2O$ with strong mixing), the mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere are\nmodified due to changes in the quenched ratios affected by the temperature\nvariation in the lower atmosphere. This alters the mixing ratio of other\nspecies (e.g. NO and $\\rm CO_2$) through the chemical reaction network, whose\nquenching occurs in the region without much temperature change. The mixing\nratios of $\\rm CH_4$, $\\rm H_2O$, and $\\rm NH_3$ decrease in the lower\natmosphere with increasing mixing heat flux, similarly reducing these ratios in\nthe upper atmosphere. Conversely, the mixing ratios of CO, $\\rm CO_2$, and NO\nrise in the lower atmosphere, with CO and $\\rm CO_2$ also increasing in the\nupper levels, although NO decreases. Weaker host star irradiation lowers the\noverall temperature of the planet, allowing a smaller mixing to have a similar\neffect. We conclude that understanding the vertical mixing heat flux is\nessential for accurate atmospheric chemistry modeling and retrieval."}

Vallis"], "title": "Mechanisms of Superrotation in Slowly-Rotating and Tidally-Locked Planets", "comment": "Submitted to the Planetary Science Journal", "summary": "Superrotation is a common feature of quickly rotating gas giants, slowly\nrotating planetary bodies, and tidally-locked planets. In this paper we compare\nand contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and\ntidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying\nin particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size,\nrotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad\n(which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model\nthat contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet\nremains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the\nbehavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a\nMatsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is\ninsufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are\nadditional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the\nsuperrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in\nstatistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate:\nsubrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak\nlow-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is\nalways linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of\nsuperrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the\ncontinuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from\naxisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively\nstronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly\ndominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing\nsuperrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist. These results provide a\nunified view of superrotation mechanisms across a wide range of planetary\nbodies."}

We processed a dataset of 584 Geminid fireballs observed by FRIPON\nbetween 2016 and 2023. The single-station astrometric data is converted into\nthe Global Fireball Exchange (GFE) standard format for uniform processing. We\nassess variations in trajectory, velocity, radiant, and orbital element\ncalculations across the pipelines and compare them to previously published\nGeminid measurements.\n  Results. The radiant and velocity solutions provided by the four data\nreduction pipelines are all within the range of previously published values.\nHowever, there are some nuances. Particularly, the radiants estimated by WMPL,\nDFN, and AMOS are nearly identical. Whereas FRIPON reports a systematic shift\nin right ascension (-0.3 degrees), caused by improper handling of the\nprecession. Additionally, the FRIPON data reduction pipeline also tends to\noverestimate the initial velocity (+0.3 km s-1) due to the deceleration model\nused as the velocity solver. The FRIPON velocity method relies on having a\nwell-constrained deceleration profile; however, for the Geminids, many are\nlow-deceleration events, leading to an overestimation of the initial velocity.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the DFN tends to predict lower velocities,\nparticularly for poorly observed events. However, this velocity shift vanishes\nfor the DFN when we only consider Geminids with at least three observations or\nmore. The primary difference identified in the analysis concerns the velocity\nuncertainties. Despite all four pipelines achieving similar residuals between\ntheir trajectories and observations, their velocity uncertainties vary\nsystematically, with WMPL outputting the smallest values, followed by AMOS,\nFRIPON, and DFN."}

Quantifying the extent of this contamination is essential for\naccurate measurements of atmospheric composition, as stellar activity can\nmanifest as false atmospheric signals in planetary transmission spectra. We\npresent a study of hot Jupiter HD 189733b, which has over 50 hours of JWST\nobservations scheduled or taken, to measure the activity level of the host star\nat the current epoch. We utilize high-resolution spectra of the H${\\alpha}$\nline from the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10-m GTC to examine the activity level\nof HD 189733 during a transit. We measure H${\\alpha}$ becoming shallower\nmid-transit by an H${\\alpha}$ index of ${\\delta}$ = 0.00156 ${\\pm}$ 0.00026,\nwhich suggests that HD 189733b crosses an active region as it transits. We\nposit this deviation is likely caused by a spot along the transit chord with an\napproximate radius of $R_{spot}$ = 3.47 ${\\pm}$ 0.30R${\\oplus}$ becoming\nocculted during transit. Including an approximation for unocculted spots, we\nestimate that this spot could result in transit depth variations of ${\\sim}$17\nppm at the 4.3 micron CO2 feature. Since this is comparable to JWST NIRCam\nGrism mode's noise floor of ${\\sim}$20 ppm, it could bias atmospheric studies\nby altering the inferred depths of the planet's features. Thus, we suggest\nground-based high-resolution monitoring of activity indicator species\nconcurrently taken with JWST data when feasible to disentangle stellar activity\nsignals from planetary atmospheric signals during transit."}
