Using photometric data from\nthe TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets\nwith post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on\nthe giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates,\nthirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of\n\\Ntotal\\ post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end\nof the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an\noccurrence rate of $0.28 \\pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting\npost-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar\nsub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \\pm 0.05$% for a sub-population\nrepresenting the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and\n$0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show\nthat the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar\nevolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter\nperiod planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short\nperiod giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of\nthe host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the\ndestruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of\nplanet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the\nplanets' orbits."}

Recently, a study of Centaur injection in the three-body\nproblem showed that Neptune-crossing TNOs in the polar corridor in the range\n[40:160] au have dynamical times that exceed the Solar System's age suggesting\nthe presence of long-lived Centaur-producing reservoirs. We demonstrate the\nexistence of such reservoirs in the Solar System by simulating the TNOs'\ntime-forward evolution in the presence of the giant planets, the Galactic tide\nand passing stars using the IAS15 integrator of the REBOUND and REBOUNDx\npackages. We also assess the efficiency of Centaur injection as a function of\nthe initial inclination and determine if high-inclination Centaurs may be\nproduced by low inclination reservoirs. We find that TNO reservoirs in the\nsemi-major axis range [50:140] au are long-lived and their populations peak at\nthe Tisserand parameters T=0.5 and T=-1.5. Saturn is found to induce secondary\nstructures in the polar corridor by holding the perihelia of a fraction of\nhigh-inclination reservoir material. We find that the Centaur inclination at\nminimum semi-major axis depends linearly on the Tisserand parameter regardless\nof the initial semi-major axis. Its amplitude shows that low inclination\nreservoirs such as the early protoplanetary disk are unlikely to produce\nhigh-inclination Centaurs in contrast to reservoirs in the polar corridor. We\nidentified the likely location of the closest reservoirs to Neptune populated\nby TNOs captured in the early Solar System that produce high-inclination\nCentaurs. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to constrain the\nreservoirs' extent and population size"}

In this work we explore\nhow these events affect our retrievals of transit depths, and the accuracy with\nwhich we can derive spot properties. We inject and recover synthetic SCEs in\nphotometric lightcurves using starry. We find that for high signal-to-noise\nSCEs we constrain the spot longitudes tightly (>80% within 1 degree of the true\nvalue), but degeneracies complicate retrieving spot contrasts, radii and\nlatitudes (within 17%, 19%, and 9 degrees respectively). On average the\ndifference between injected and recovered transit depths is 0.78% or 78.3ppm.\nIn most (80%) injections we recover the transit depth to within 0.6%. For\ntransit depths inflated >1.3% by the Transit Light Source Effect (TLSE),\nfitting for a spot-crossing improves the transit depth retrieval over masking\nthe SCE in >95% of cases. However, we find that for spots with small contrasts\n(<5%) and/or covering fractions (<2%), we are likely to over-correct for the\nTLSE, recovering a worse transit depth than simply masking. In addition, even\nwhen fitted, we find SCEs can inflate the uncertainties on recovered transit\ndepths significantly, especially for JWST-like precisions. Finally, we\ndetermine how SCE observables can narrow the degenerate spot parameter space to\nprovide useful priors for MCMC sampling, demonstrating this technique on a real\nSCE observed in Kepler-51d's lightcurve."}

This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations.

Accepted to ApJ", "summary": "Microlensing observations suggest that the mass distribution of free-floating\nplanets (FFPs) follows a declining power-law with increasing mass. The origin\nof such distribution is unclear. Using a population synthesis framework, we\ninvestigate the formation channel and properties of FFPs, and compare the\npredicted mass function with observations. Assuming FFPs originate from\nplanet-planet scattering and ejection in single star systems, we model their\nmass function using a Monte Carlo based planet population synthesis model\ncombined with N-body simulations. We adopt a realistic stellar initial mass\nfunction, which naturally results in a large fraction of planetary systems\norbiting low-mass stars. The predicted FFP mass function is broadly consistent\nwith observation: it follows the observed power-law at higher masses ($10\n\\lesssim m/M_\\oplus < 10^4$), while at lower masses ($0.1 < m/M_\\oplus \\lesssim\n10$) it flattens, remaining marginally consistent with the lower bound of the\nobservational uncertainties. Low-mass, close-in planets tend to remain bound,\nwhile Neptune-like planets at wide orbits dominate the ejected population due\nto their large Hill radii and shallow gravitational binding. We also compare\nthe mass distribution of bound planets with microlensing observations and find\nreasonably good agreement with both surveys. Our model predicts $\\simeq 1.20$\nejected planets per star in the mass range of $0.33 < m/M_\\oplus < 6660$, with\na total FFP mass of $\\simeq 17.98~M_\\oplus$ per star.

The Euclid Galactic Bulge Survey represents a unique\nopportunity to revisit a large number of past events and attempt the\nlens-source resolution of known events falling in the covered area. As the\nanalysis of individual events requires non-negligible efforts, it is important\nto establish priorities among all possible targets, identifying those\ncandidates with the higher chance for a successful resolution of the lens from\nthe source and with the highest scientific interest. Drawing from the databases\nof the three main microlensing surveys (OGLE, MOA and KMTNet), we compile the\ncomplete catalog of past microlensing events in the Euclid survey footprint up\nto year 2023, containing 8081 entries. By re-modeling all events and\ncross-checking with Galactic models, we estimate the relative lens-source\nproper motions for all events. Taking into account all uncertainties, for each\nmicrolensing event we are able to estimate the probability that the lens is\nseparated from the source by more than a given angular distance threshold.\nHence, we rank all events by their resolution probability, providing additional\nuseful information that will guide future analyses on the most promising\ncandidates.

We generate a synthetic\npopulation of $\\sim10^{10}$ interstellar objects with M-star kinematics in\norder to obtain $\\sim10^4$ Earth-impactors. The relative flux of impactors\narriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is\nenhanced by a factor of $\\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors\nalso arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally\nslower than objects in the overall population. This is because the\nEarth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity\nhyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing.\nEarth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits\nclose to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of\ninclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at\nlow/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher\nimpact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population\ntherefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and\nsinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring\nwhen the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general\nare more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the\ndirection of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the\nEarth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the\nNorthern hemisphere due to the location of the apex.
