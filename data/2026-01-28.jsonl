Benchmarking the Sonora Diamondback and Saumon & Marley (2008) Atmospheric Models Across Late-M, L, and T types with Low-Resolution 0.8-2.5 $μ$m Spectroscopy", "comment": "AJ, in press. A CSV table and figures summarizing the full analysis results for the benchmark targets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18375777", "summary": "(Abridged) We present a systematic assessment of two major cloudy atmospheric model grids -- SM08 (Saumon & Marley 2008) and Sonora Diamondback -- when applied to low-resolution near-infrared (0.8-2.5 $μ$m) spectroscopy. Our analysis focuses on a uniform sample of 142 age-benchmark brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects spanning late-M, L, and T spectral types, with independently determined ages from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr. We perform forward-model spectral fitting for all benchmarks' IRTF/SpeX spectra ($R\\sim$80-250) using both SM08 and Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models to infer effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and cloud sedimentation efficiencies. The two model grids yield broadly consistent results. Among L4-L9 dwarfs, we identify a statistically significant, population-level age dependence of the cloud parameter $f_{\\rm sed}$, with young benchmarks ($<300$ Myr) exhibiting systematically lower $f_{\\rm sed}$ values than older counterparts. This trend is absent across L0-T5 and T0-T5, demonstrating that cloud properties vary with age and surface gravity and offering explanations for the observed gravity-dependent photometric properties at the late-L end of the L/T transition. By comparing spectroscopically inferred parameters with predictions from evolution models, we quantify systematic errors in the fitted atmospheric parameters and establish empirical calibrations to anchor future studies using these atmospheric models. Stacked residuals of the sample reveal wavelength-dependent data-model mismatches associated with key atomic and molecular absorption bands, highlighting the need for improved opacities and rainout chemistry. Finally, we show that including an interstellar-medium-like extinction term significantly improves the spectral fits, confirming and broadening previous findings and suggesting missing opacity sources in current cloudy models."}

We recover the previously-detected rise in occurrence with semimajor axis for both lower- and higher-mass subsets of the population out to $\\sim$5 au. When restricting to planets with semimajor axes between 0.1 and 4.5 au (roughly speaking, the \"peak\" of giant planet occurrence), we find evidence for distinct eccentricity distributions for each of two mass sub-populations. Most strikingly, we observe a peak in the eccentricity distribution of super-Jovian planets (3-20~M$_{\\rm J}$) at 0.3, which is apparent using two different parameterizations of the eccentricity distribution model. A hierarchical histogram model reveals that $\\sim$92% of posterior samples indicate an elevated occurrence rate of super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities (0.2-0.4) compared to lower or higher eccentricities (i.e. evidence for a moderate eccentricity \"peak\"), and 99% of samples indicate super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities are more common than those with lower eccentricities (i.e. evidence that moderate eccentricities are more common than low eccentricities). We use a truncated Gaussian model fit to pinpoint the location of the super-Jupiter eccentricity peak with more precision, finding a maximum a posterior (MAP) peak location of $e=0.3$. This low but elevated characteristic eccentricity could be the result of dynamically hot histories, perhaps involving a giant impacts phase.

We report detections of CS $J=6-5$, N$_2$H$^+$ $J=3-2$, C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$, H$_2$CS $J_{K_a, K_c} = 8_{1,7}-7_{1,6}$, H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$, and H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{2,3}-3_{2,2}$, as well as a tentative detection of $^{13}$C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$. We observe azimuthal asymmetry in CS and H$_2$CS emission, as well as radially structured H$_2$CO $4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ emission outside the dust continuum. C$^{18}$O and H$_2$CO 4$_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ show significant cloud contamination, while CS and N$_2$H$^+$ are good tracers of Keplerian rotation originating from the disk. Envelope emission does not appear to contribute significantly either to the continuum or molecular line observations. GY 91's chemical properties appear in large part to resemble those of Class II disks, although observations of additional molecular probes should be obtained for a fuller comparison. With CS, we estimated a dynamical stellar mass of 0.58 $M_\\odot$, which is higher than previous estimates from stellar evolutionary models (0.25 $M_\\odot$). Using both radiative transfer modeling of the dust continuum and comparison of the C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes to literature thermochemical models, we estimate a disk mass of $\\sim0.01$ $M_\\odot$."}

It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below ~3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass (~0.53 Msun to ~0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young (~1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that ~95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach ~8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities."}

Nemeth"], "title": "Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques", "comment": "9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St<=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St<=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems."}

The diameter of 2025 FA22 is estimated between 130 and 290 meters. It is among the largest NEAs observable at such proximity, prompting an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) rapidresponse campaign. Although early orbital solutions indicated a possible impact in 2089, further follow-up astrometric observations ruled out collision hazard. The favourable geometry of this close encounter enabled a dense coverage of the positive part of the phasepolarisation curve, from the high polarisation domain (high phase angles), nearly to the inversion angle where the linear polarisation rate vanishes. The spectropolarimetric observations provided the wavelength dependence of the polarisation rate. Using empirical relationships, an estimate of the geometric albedo could be drawn from the slope of the phase-polarisation curve at inversion angle. Moreover, the spectropolarimetric trends yielded constraints on the taxonomic class. These results demonstrate the interest of polarimetry and spectropolarimetry for rapid characterisation of newly discovered NEAs in planetary defence campaigns."}

Published in ApJL", "summary": "The transit method is currently one of our best means for the detection of potentially habitable \"Earth-like\" exoplanets. In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the $V=10.1$ K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow ($225\\pm10$ ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of $1.06^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ $R_\\oplus$, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of $355^{+200}_{-59}$ days ($a=0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.10}$ AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of $0.29^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ $I_\\oplus$, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone. This is the first planet candidate with Earth-like radius and orbital properties that transits a Sun-like star bright enough for substantial follow-up observations."}
