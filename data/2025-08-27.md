TL;DR: ASTRONAUT是一个基于AWS S3的公开毫米波小行星观测数据库，包含2017-2021年ACT望远镜在90、150、220GHz频段对170个小行星的流量测量数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为天文学研究社区提供一个标准化的毫米波小行星观测数据库，方便研究人员获取和使用这些珍贵的观测数据。

Method: 利用阿塔卡马宇宙学望远镜(ACT)在2017-2021年间收集毫米波观测数据，通过信号噪声比筛选（SNR>5），构建包含观测时间、归一化流量值和误差条的数据库。

Result: 成功建立了包含170个小行星观测数据的公开S3数据库，提供了光变曲线生成示例和Jupyter notebook参考指南。

Conclusion: ASTRONAUT数据库为小行星毫米波研究提供了宝贵资源，所有数据和工具都已公开在GitHub上，便于科学社区使用。

Abstract: We present A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT
(ASTRONAUT) hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) in the form of a public
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This bucket is an Amazon cloud
storage database containing flux measurements for a group of asteroids at
millimeter (mm) wavelengths. These measurements were collected by the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021 in frequency bands centered near
90, 150, and 220 GHz. The ASTRONAUT database contains observation times,
normalized flux values, and associated error bars for 170 asteroids above a
signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for a single frequency band over the stacked
co-added maps. We provide an example in generating light curves with this
database. We also present a Jupyter notebook to serve as a reference guide when
using the S3 bucket. The container and notebook are publicly available in a
GitHub repository.

### [2] [Enriched volatiles and refractories but deficient titanium on the dayside atmosphere of WASP-121b revealed by JWST/NIRISS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18341)

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过两次NIRISS/SOSS二次蔽风观测，分析了超热木星WASP-121b白天面的大气组成和热结构，发现其大气存在平流层逆转，金属度丰富（~10倍星院）但铀贫穷（~1倍星院），并推断存在夜面冷捕获机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超热木星白天面温度极高，所有大气成分都以气态形式存在，为探索巨大行星的组成提供了独特机会。研究者希望通过观测数据推断WASP-121b的大气组成和热结构特征。

Method: 使用两个独立的数据处理流程提取WASP-121b的蔽风谱，采用不同的大气反汇方法分析，考察热解离、反射光和铀凝结等因素对大气特性推断的影响。

Result: 观测到WASP-121b白天面谱最佳符合平流层逆转模型（温度超过3000K），谱线来自H2O、CO、VO、H-以及TiO或反射光。大气金属度丰富（~10倍星院）但铀贫穷（~1倍星院），C/O比依赖于模型假设，从与星院一致到超过星院。

Conclusion: WASP-121b具有时捷金属和耐热金属丰富的大气，但铀贫穷，还推断存在夜面冷捕获机制。H2O热解离在自由反汇分析中至关重要，如果忽略会导致获取到的元素丰度存在数量级差异。简单化学平衡反汇假设所有物质都受单一金属度参数控制会严重高估TiO丰度。

Abstract: With dayside temperatures elevated enough for all atmospheric constituents to
be present in gas form, ultra-hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to probe
the composition of giant planets. We aim to infer the composition and thermal
structure of the dayside atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b from two
NIRISS$/$SOSS secondary eclipses observed as part of a full phase curve. We
extract the eclipse spectrum of WASP-121b with two independent data reduction
pipelines and analyse it using different atmospheric retrieval prescriptions to
explore the effects of thermal dissociation, reflected light, and titanium
condensation on the inferred atmospheric properties. We find that the observed
dayside spectrum of WASP-121b is best fit by atmosphere models possessing a
stratospheric inversion with temperatures reaching over 3000K, with spectral
contributions from H2O, CO, VO, H-, and either TiO or reflected light. We
measure the atmosphere of WASP-121b to be metal enriched (~10x stellar) but
comparatively titanium poor (~1x stellar), potentially due to partial
cold-trapping. The inferred C/O depends on model assumptions such as whether
reflected light is included, ranging from being consistent with stellar if a
geometric albedo of zero is assumed to being super-stellar for a freely fitted
Ag = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The volatile-to-refractory ratio is measured to be
consistent with the stellar value. We infer that WASP-121b has an atmosphere
enriched in both volatile and refractory metals, but not in ultra-refractory
titanium, suggesting the presence of a nightside cold-trap. Considering H2O
dissociation is critical in free retrieval analyses, leading to
order-of-magnitude differences in retrieved abundances for WASP-121b if
neglected. Simple chemical equilibrium retrievals assuming that all species are
governed by a single metallicity parameter drastically overpredict the TiO
abundance.

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb were the lowest mass-ratio
microlensing planets at the time of discovery. For both events, microlensing
parallax measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope implied lens systems
that were more distant and massive than those inferred from the ground-based
parallax. Here, we report on the detection of excess flux aligned to the event
locations using Keck Adaptive Optics imaging, which is consistent with the
expected brightness of main-sequence hosts under the ground-based parallax, but
inconsistent with that predicted by Spitzer. Based on the excess flux,
ground-based parallax, and angular Einstein radius, we determine
KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb to be a $4.2\pm0.5 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.70\pm0.07
M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $3.1\pm0.3$ au, and
OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb to be a $2.0\pm0.2 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a
$0.40\pm0.03 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $1.7\pm0.1$ au. We
report on additional light-curve models for KMT-2018-BLG-0029 under the
generalized inner-outer (offset) degeneracy, which were not reported in the
original analysis. We point out inconsistencies in the inner/outer labeling of
the degenerate models in the lens and source planes, and advocate for the
lens-plane convention, which refers to the planet being closer or further to
the host star compared to the image it perturbs. Lastly, we discuss the
possibility of breaking this degeneracy via ground concurrent observations with
the Roman Space Telescope.

TL;DR: 利用VLT/MUSE观测发现AB Aur b原行星在Hα谱线蓝移端发射、红移端吸收，呈现类似逆P Cygni轮廓的特征，可能表明存在气体吸积过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析AB Aurigae系统中的原行星AB Aur b的Hα光谱特征，探究其吸积过程和其他可能的发射机制

Method: 使用VLT的MUSE仪器进行高对比度、中分辨率Hα光谱观测，分析不同波长段的发射和吸收特征

Result: 检测到AB Aur b在Hα蓝移端(6558.88-6560.13 Å)发射，红移端(6562.8-6565.1 Å)吸收，光谱形状类似T Tauri星中的逆P Cygni轮廓，表明可能存在气体吸积

Conclusion: 这是第二个在Hα检测到的原行星系统，第一个呈现逆P Cygni轮廓特征，需要进一步建模和光学数据来确定发射源机制

Abstract: We analyze high-contrast, medium-spectral-resolution $H_{\rm \alpha}$
observations of the star AB Aurigae using the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In multiple epochs, MUSE detects the AB Aur b
protoplanet discovered from Subaru/SCExAO data in emission at wavelengths
slightly blue-shifted from the $H_{\rm \alpha}$ line center (i.e. at
6558.88--6560.13 \AA; $\sim$ -100 km s$^{-1}$) and in absorption at redshifted
wavelengths (6562.8--6565.1 \AA; $\sim$ 75 km s$^{-1}$). AB Aur b's $H_{\rm
\alpha}$ spectrum is inconsistent with that of the host star or the average
residual disk spectrum and is dissimilar to that of PDS 70 b and c. Instead,
the spectrum's shape resembles that of an inverse P Cygni profile seen in some
accreting T Tauri stars and interpreted as evidence of infalling cold gas from
accretion, although we cannot formally rule out all other nonaccretion origins
for AB Aur b's MUSE detection. AB Aurigae hosts only the second protoplanetary
system detected in $H_{\rm \alpha}$ thus far and the first with a source
showing a spectrum resembling an inverse P Cygni profile. Future modeling and
new optical data will be needed to assess how much of AB Aur b's emission
source(s) originates from protoplanet accretion reprocessed by the disk, a
localized scattered-light feature with a unique $H_{\rm \alpha}$ profile, or
another mechanism.

TL;DR: 通过TESS数据分析54个系统的转显时间，识别出8个行星轨道衰减的系统，为潮汰耐质量因子Q*'提供了新的观测约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潮汰耐质量因子Q*'在理论上存在数量级的不确定性，需要通过观测行星轨道衰减来验证潮汰耐散机制

Method: 使用TESS数据获取54个系统的中天转显时间，采用贝叶斯信息准则评估轨道周期的偏移，并使用理论关系确定潮汰耐质量因子

Result: 25个系统显示轨道周期减小的证据，8个系统(CoRoT-2等)显示显著的轨道衰减，但Q*'的下限仍远低于理论预期值

Conclusion: 这些新的转显时间约束和Q*'值将有助于缩小未来寻找轨道衰减的范围，并为当前星球相互作用理论提供重要约束

Abstract: Tidal interactions are one of the primary drivers of orbital evolution for
massive planets with short orbital periods. Tidal dissipation within host stars
can cause the orbits of such planets to decay. However, the mechanisms of tidal
dissipation are difficult to probe. Generally, tidal dissipation is
parameterized by the modified stellar tidal quality factor, or $Q_{*}^{'}$, but
the lack of observational evidence of orbital decay to confirm dissipation
theories has resulted in orders of magnitude of uncertainty in $Q_{*}^{'}$. We
present a new transit timing analysis of 54 systems with varying stellar
evolutionary states in an attempt to search for orbital decay across multiple
stages of stellar evolution. For each system, we obtained mid-transit times
from new TESS data and evaluated potential departures from a linear ephemeris
using the Bayesian Information Criterion. We then determined tidal quality
factors using widely tested theoretical relations. Of the systems studied, 25
showed evidence of a decrease in orbital period over time and 8 showed evidence
of a decrease that was inconsistent with 0 by three standard deviations:
CoRoT-2, TrES-5, WASP-4, WASP-12, WASP-19, WASP-45, WASP-99, and XO-3. However,
the significance of some of these detections may be influenced by unreliable
transit time measurements. Similarly, we see that the lower limit on
$Q_{*}^{'}$ for evolved systems is marginally lower than it is for the sample
of all systems, though both limits are orders of magnitude below the expected
theoretical values for both samples. These new constraints on transit times and
$Q_{*}^{'}$ values will help to narrow the search for orbital decay in the
future and place important constraints on current theories of star-planet
interactions.

### [6] [The mid-infrared spectrum of $β$ Pictoris b. First VLTI/MATISSE interferometric observations of an exoplanet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18366)

TL;DR: 本文通过VLTI/MATISSE中红外干涉仪获得了巨行星β Pictoris b在L和M波段(2.75-5 μm)的高信噪比谱，发现大气中含有H2O和CO吸收带，并确认其碳氧比为太阳水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中红外区域(>3 μm)导影星光谱数据缺乏，而该区域含有丰富的分子谱线签识，可以提供大气参数和帮助理解巨行星形成机制。

Method: 利用VLTI/MATISSE中红外干涉仪，结合GRA4MAT升级的条纹跟踪和离轴指向功能，观测β Pictoris b。发展了一种答处色散和非共路影响的方法，并建立行星测量和星光污染模型。

Result: 获得了β Pictoris b在L和M波段的高信噪比谱，首次在L波段观测到巨行星连续谱，识别出H2O和CO的广泛吸收带。结合GRAVITY谱数据通过ForMoSA和Exo-REM大气模型分析，发现大气碳氧比与太阳相似。

Conclusion: 该研究为MATISSE定性更暗和更近的影星打开了途径，可以在JWST无法观测的近角距分离处补充JWST。GRAVITY+升级将从2025年起进一步扩大MATISSE的检测极限。

Abstract: Few spectra of directly-imaged exoplanets have been obtained in the
mid-infrared (> 3 $\mu$m). This region is particularly rich in molecular
spectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters
and provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric
dynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY
instrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar
companions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow
for the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close
angular separations (< 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the
mid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We
take advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities
recently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the
giant planet $\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\mu$m) at a spectral
resolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and
non-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry
and stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of
$\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and
M bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In
conjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested
sampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar
carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to
the characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could
complement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet
spectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the
GRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE.

TL;DR: WISPIT调查发现了两个广季分离的巨大气体行星WISPIT 1b和WISPIT 1c，违绕K4-M5.5双星系运行，质量分别为10和4本星质量，投影分离距为338和840天文单位。


<details>

Motivation: 广季分离巨大气体行星形成理论面临挑战，WISPIT调查通过检测和定性不同年龄的近太阳型主星周围的广季分离行星体，以约束其形成路径。

Method: 使用VLT/SPHERE仪器和IRDIS相机进行两次5分钟H波段观测，间隔至少6个月，通过自行运分析识别同移伴星。结合Ks波段观测确定颜色-星等，与AMES-COND和AMES-DUSTY进化轨道比较推导质量。

Result: 在WISPIT 1双星系中发现两个同移行星体：WISPIT 1b（10 Mj，338 au）和WISPIT 1c（4 Mj，840 au）。这是首次在太阳型主星周围发现的广季分离行星系统。

Conclusion: 这些发现为行星形成理论提供了重要约束。WISPIT 1b和1c是地面和太空望远镜后续定性的理想目标，GRAVITY干涉仪进行轨道监测可以约束偏心率，光谱定性可以确定组成和金属度，为研究其形成过程提供信息。

Abstract: Wide separation gas giant planets present a challenge to current planet
formation theories, and the detection and characterisation of these systems
enables us to constrain their formation pathways. The WIde Separation Planets
In Time (WISPIT) survey aims to detect and characterise wide separation
planetary-mass companions over a range of ages from <5 to 20 Myr around
solar-type host stars at distances of 75-500 (median: 140) parsecs. The WISPIT
survey carries out two 5 minute H-band exposures with the VLT/SPHERE instrument
and IRDIS camera, separated by at least six months to identify co-moving
companions via proper motion analysis. These two H-band observations in
combination with a follow-up Ks-band observation were used to determine the
colour-magnitude of the co-moving companions and to derive their masses by
comparing to AMES-COND and AMES-DUSTY evolutionary tracks. We report the
discovery of WISPIT 1b and WISPIT 1c, two gas giant exoplanets that are
co-moving with the stellar binary WISPIT 1, which itself consists of a K4 star
and M5.5 star in a multi-decadal orbit. The planets are at projected
separations of 338 au and 840 au and have masses of 10 Mj and 4 Mj
respectively. We identified two common proper motion planetary companions to a
(previously unknown) stellar binary with a Sun-like primary. These targets are
ideal for follow up characterisation with both ground and space-based
telescopes. Monitoring of the orbit with the GRAVITY interferometer will place
constraints on their eccentricity, and spectroscopic characterisation will
identify the composition and metallicity, providing information on their
formation pathways.

Result: 1996 FG3系统温度范围100-475K，日食和热惯性使次星表面温度变化达14%，BYORP系数变化约7%，导致扭矩降低和半长轴收缩减少约20米/万年

Conclusion: 热效应足以改变温度和BYORP计算，建模时应包含这些效应，不同系统的重要性会随性质变化

Abstract: Differential heating and radiation on asymmetric asteroids can cause
measurable changes in their rotation rates and spin axes, known as the YORP
effect. In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual
asteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary
asteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and
BYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D
conduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered
infrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from
horizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and
secondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706)
1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3
system experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses
and thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with
a mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also
present a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical
model results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the
BYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and
thermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP
coefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by
approximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small,
in the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the
semimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that
thermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that
they should be included when modeling binaries. The relative importance of each
effect is predicted to vary with the properties of the studied system.

Conclusion: 证明地面高分辨率光谱学在研究较冷外星星大气时错误质量更低，但需要进一步研究解释检测信号位置偏移等异常现象

Abstract: Atmospheres of transiting exoplanets can be studied spectroscopically using
space-based or ground-based observations. Each has its own strengths and
weaknesses, so there are benefits to both approaches. This is especially true
for challenging targets such as cooler, smaller exoplanets whose atmospheres
likely contain many molecular species and cloud decks.
  We aim to study the atmosphere of the warm Neptune-like exoplanet WASP-107 b
(Teq~740 K). Several molecular species have been detected in this exoplanet in
recent space-based JWST studies, and we aim to confirm and expand upon these
detections using ground-based VLT, evaluating how well our findings agree with
previously retrieved atmospheric parameters.
  We observe two transits of WASP-107 b with VLT/CRIRES+ and create
cross-correlation templates of the target atmosphere based on retrieval results
from JWST studies. We create different templates to investigate the impact of
varying volume mixing ratios of species and inclusion or exclusion of clouds.
Considering this target's observational challenges, we create simulated
observations prior to evaluating real data to assess expected detection
significances.
  We report detections of two molecular species, CO (~6 S/N) and H2O (~4.5
S/N). This confirms previous space-based detections and demonstrates, for the
first time, the capability of VLT/CRIRES+ to detect species in targets cooler
than hot Jupiters using transmission spectroscopy. We show our analysis is
sensitive to cloud inclusion, but less so to different volume mixing ratios.
Interestingly, our detection deviates from its expected location in our Kp-vsys
diagrams, and we speculate on possible reasons for this. We demonstrate that
the error budget for relatively cooler exoplanets is severely reduced in
comparison to hotter exoplanets, and underline need for further work in context
of high-resolution spectroscopy.

mas; (~54 au deprojected), PA=242.21$\pm$0.41 degrees) likely clearing a
dust-free gap between the two brightest dust rings in the transitional disk.
Our SNR=12.5 detection gave an H$_{\alpha}$ ASDI contrast of
(6.5$\pm$0.5)x10$^{-4}$ and a H$_{\alpha}$ line flux of
(1.29$\pm$0.28)x10$^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We also present L' photometry from
LBT/LMIRcam of the planet (L'=15.30$\pm$0.05 mag) which, when coupled with an
age of 5.1$^{+2.4}_{-1.3}$ Myr, yields a planet mass estimate of 5.3$\pm$1.0
Mjup from the DUSTY evolutionary models. WISPIT 2b is accreting at
2.25$^{-0.17}_{+3.75}$x10$^{-12}$ Msun/yr. WISPIT 2b is very similar to the
other H$_{\alpha}$ protoplanets in terms of mass, age, flux, and accretion
rate. The inclination of the system (${\it i}$=44 degrees) is also,
surprisingly, very similar to the other known H$\alpha$ protoplanet systems
which all cluster from 37$\leq{\it i}\leq$52 degrees. We argue this clustering
has only a ~1.0% (2.6 sigma) probability of occurring randomly, and so we
speculate that magnetospherical accretion might have a preferred inclination
range (~37-52 degrees) for the direct (cloud free, low extinction) line of
sight to the H-alpha line formation/shock region. We also find at 110mas (~15au
deprojected) a close companion candidate (CC1) which may be consistent with an
inner dusty 9$\pm$4 Mjup planet.

Abstract: In the past decades several thousand exoplanet systems have been discovered
around evolved, main-sequence stars, revealing a wide diversity in their
architectures. To understand how the planet formation process can lead to
vastly different outcomes in system architecture we have to study the starting
conditions of planet formation within the disks around young stars. In this
study we are presenting high resolution direct imaging observations with
VLT/SPHERE of the young ($\sim$5 Myr), nearby ($\sim$133 pc), solar-analog
designated as WISPIT 2($=$ TYC~5709-354-1). These observations were taken as
part of our survey program that explores the formation and orbital evolution of
wide-separation gas giants. WISPIT 2 was observed in four independent epochs
using polarized light and total intensity observations. They reveal for the
first time an extended (380 au) disk in scattered light with a multi-ringed
sub-structure. We directly detect a young proto-planet WISPIT 2b, embedded in a
disk gap and show that it is co-moving with its host star. Multiple SPHERE
epochs demonstrate that it shows orbital motion consistent with Keplerian
motion in the observed disk gap. Our $H$ and $K_s$-band photometric data are
consistent with thermal emission from a young planet. By comparison with planet
evolutionary models, we find a mass of the planet of $4.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$
Jupiter masses. This mass is also consistent with the width of the observed
disk gap, retrieved from hydrodynamic models. WISPIT 2b is the first
unambiguous planet detection in a multi-ringed disk, making the WISPIT 2 system
the ideal laboratory to study planet-disk interaction and subsequent evolution.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在不同恒星类型和大气成分下，氧气(O2)与臭氧(O3)的非线性关系，特别关注甲烷(CH4)浓度变化对O2-O3关系的影响，以确定O3作为O2替代生物标志物的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在宇宙生命搜寻中，O2与还原性物质(如CH4)的组合是重要的生物标志物。当难以直接检测O2时，需要研究O3作为O2替代指标的可靠性，因为O2-O3关系受多种因素影响。

Method: 使用光化学和气候模型模拟类地行星，O2浓度范围为0.01%-150%现代大气水平(PAL)，CH4浓度分别为10%和1000% PAL，分析不同主恒星类型下的O2-O3关系。

Result: 发现CH4变化对O2-O3关系的影响高度依赖于主恒星类型和O2丰度。高CH4模型在高O2大气中，CH4有效转化为H2O影响平流层温度，进而影响O3形成/破坏速率。HO_x变化影响催化循环和烟雾O3形成，导致到达地表的紫外辐射和9.6μm O3发射光谱特征变化。

Conclusion: 需要深入研究O2-O3关系，才能在未来观测中可靠地使用O3作为O2的替代指标，因为这种关系受多种因素复杂影响。

Abstract: In the search for life in the Universe, molecular oxygen (O$_2$) combined
with a reducing species, such as methane (CH$_4$), is considered a promising
disequilibrium biosignature. In cases where it would be difficult or impossible
to detect O$_2$ (e.g., mid-IR or low O$_2$ levels), it has been suggested that
ozone (O$_3$), the photochemical product of O$_2$, could be used as a proxy for
determining the abundance of O$_2$. As the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship is
nonlinear, the goal of this series of papers is to explore how it would change
for different host stars and atmospheric compositions and learning how to use
O$_3$ to infer O$_2$. We used photochemistry and climate modeling to further
explore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship by modeling Earth-like planets with the
present atmospheric level (PAL) of O$_2$ between 0.01% to 150% along with high
and low CH$_4$ abundances of 1000% and 10% PAL, respectively. Methane is of
interest not only because it is a biosignature, but also the source of hydrogen
atoms for hydrogen oxide (HO$_x$) which destroys O$_3$ through catalytic cycles
and acts as a catalyst for the smog mechanism of O$_3$ formation in the lower
atmosphere. We find varying CH$_4$ causes changes to the O$_2$-O$_3$
relationship in ways that are highly dependent on both host star and O$_2$
abundance. A striking result for high CH$_4$ models in high O$_2$ atmospheres
around hotter hosts is that enough CH$_4$ is efficiently converted into H$_2$O
to significantly impact stratospheric temperatures, and therefore the
formation/destruction rates of O$_3$. Changes in HO$_x$ also influenced the
HO$_x$ catalytic cycle and smog O$_3$, causing variations in harmful UV
reaching the surface as well as changes in the 9.6~$\mu$m O$_3$ feature in
emission spectra. This demonstrates the need to explore the O$_2$-O$_3$
relationship in order to use O$_3$ as a reliable proxy for O$_2$ in future
observations.

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of
sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to
strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes (100 bar-100 kbar) and
atmospheres (1 mbar-100 bar). At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, >10
kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas
behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute
equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of
state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune
potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in
magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental
data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at
the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by
CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both
magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in
magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry
through the atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that condensation of
$\beta$-quartz 'clouds' depletes Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains
abundant at solar metallicity. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ ratios increase with mantle melt
fraction and decrease with metallicity. These effects also deplete H$_2$ via
CH$_4$ and SiH$_4$ formation and the dissolution of H$_2$ into magma. The
competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ presents a diagnostic of metallicity and
magma oceans. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$- and
CH$_4$-poor (<5%) atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma
oceans on sub-Neptunes.
