  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法，但未能完整覆盖行星内部密度分布的解空间。需要一种计算高效且尽可能少假设的算法来全面探索行星内部结构。

Method: 采用基于优化的梯度下降方法替代传统的MCMC，设计计算高效的算法来采样行星内部密度分布的全空间。以天王星和海王星为测试案例，构建与观测质量、半径和引力矩一致的密度和压力剖面。

Result: 获得了与观测物理性质一致的经验模型；发现其他研究虽然与本文结果大体一致，但未能完整覆盖解空间；建立了密度不连续性陡度与预期不连续性数量之间的统计关系；发现不连续性主要集中在行星归一化半径0.65（天王星）和0.7（海王星）附近。

Conclusion: 该算法能够高效且完整地研究行星内部密度分布的全空间，适用于所有具有引力场数据的行星天体研究，为构建固定层数模型提供了统计指导。

Abstract: We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoid the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for an optimisation-based gradient descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.

### [2] [On the Divergent Evolution of Io and Europa as Primordial Ocean Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17004)
*Yannis Bennacer,Olivier Mousis,Vincent Hue*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究探讨木卫一和木卫二的水分差异是否源于早期演化路径不同，发现木卫二可能保留了大部分挥发物，而木卫一可能最初就吸积了无水硅酸盐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 木星伽利略卫星的密度随距离增加而降低，这可能反映了演化路径和水分散失的差异。研究旨在探究木卫一是否可能失去其水库存，而木卫二保留了挥发物。

Method: 使用内部演化模型结合大气逃逸框架，模拟原卫星的形成和早期热演化。计算木卫一和木卫二的脱水时间尺度和挥发物损失，考虑卫星吸积和卵石吸积的吸积加热，以及木星原始光度辐射。

Result: 木卫二在几乎所有合理的形成和演化情景下都可能保留了大部分挥发物，大规模脱水只会在其演化前1000万年后发生。木卫一不太可能通过大气逃逸失去大量水分，因此可能主要吸积了无水硅酸盐。

Conclusion: 如果木卫二最初吸积了含水矿物，现今木卫一和木卫二之间的挥发物差异可以通过它们在木星次星云中页硅酸盐脱水线的相对位置来解释。单独的演化路径或大气逃逸过程似乎不足以解释观测到的差异。

Abstract: The Galilean moons exhibit a decrease in bulk density with distance from Jupiter, which may reflect differences in evolutionary paths and water loss. Early in its history, Jupiter was more luminous and may have driven substantial atmospheric escape on Io and Europa. We investigate whether Io could have lost its water inventory while Europa retained its volatiles, assuming both moons initially accreted hydrous silicates. The formation and early thermal evolution of the protosatellites are modeled using an interior evolution model coupled with an atmospheric escape framework. Dehydration timescales and volatile losses for Io and Europa are computed during their early evolution, accounting for accretional heating from both satellitesimal and pebble accretion, as well as irradiation from Jupiter's primordial luminosity. Europa likely retained most of its volatiles under nearly all plausible formation and evolution scenarios, as large-scale dehydration would have taken place only after the first 10 Myr of its evolution. In contrast, Io was unlikely to lose a substantial amount of water through atmospheric escape and therefore probably accreted predominantly anhydrous silicates. If Europa initially accreted hydrous minerals, the present-day volatile contrast between Io and Europa could be explained by their relative locations with respect to the phyllosilicate dehydration line in the Jovian subnebula. Distinct evolutionary pathways or atmospheric escape processes alone appear insufficient to reproduce the observed differences.

TL;DR: 首次在银河系厚盘恒星中发现两个膨胀行星（TOI-1927 b和TOI-2643 b），挑战了低金属丰度环境下行星形成和大气保留的传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为银河系厚盘（化学古老、动态加热）的低固体物质储备、短盘寿命和强烈辐射环境会抑制行星形成，但越来越多的厚盘行星宿主星挑战了这一观点，需要系统研究早期银河系中行星形成的多样性和韧性。

Method: 对38个厚盘恒星的行星系统进行同质化表征，结合新发现和系统重新评估档案系统。使用高精度径向速度测量、空间凌星测光和均匀高分辨率光谱，通过联合化学和运动学标准确认厚盘成员资格。

Result: 发现了两个低密度膨胀行星TOI-1927 b和TOI-2643 b，这是首次在厚盘恒星中发现的膨胀行星，这一结果在低金属丰度环境中高度意外，挑战了当前的大气保留和热膨胀模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解早期银河系贫瘠、短寿命盘环境下行星结构的形成建立了新的经验基准，表明早期银河系的行星形成比标准盘演化模型预测的更具韧性和多样性。

Abstract: Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.

TL;DR: 利用Twinkle卫星对超热木星进行相位曲线观测，模拟预测能探测到所有目标行星的相位曲线信号，并生成光谱数据用于大气化学和动力学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超热木星（UHJs）是研究最多的系外行星，但关于其形成、演化和大气仍有许多未解之谜。相位曲线观测可以揭示大气环流、反照率和化学性质等关键信息。

Method: 使用物理模型模拟Twinkle卫星对14颗超热木星的白光光度相位曲线观测，以及对WASP-189b的光谱相位曲线观测，生成相位分辨的发射光谱。

Result: 预测Twinkle卫星能够探测到所有14颗UHJs的相位曲线信号，并能检测到H₂O、CO和CO₂等分子的特征谱线，对于具有热点相位偏移的行星，在光学和红外波段都能检测到。

Conclusion: 这项未来的观测调查将是首次同时覆盖光学和红外波段的UHJ相位曲线调查，将为这些极端环境提供新的约束条件并揭示有趣的趋势。

Abstract: Due to their high equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq}$ $>$ 2000 K), ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are the best characterized exoplanets to date. However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcoming $\textit{Twinkle}$ mission. $\textit{Twinkle}$ is a spectroscopic satellite covering 0.5--4.5 micron with a spectral resolving power of R $\sim$ 50--70. Using a physically motivated model, we simulate white-light photometric phase curve observations for 14 UHJs in $\textit{Twinkle's}$ field of regard. We project that $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be able to detect all phase curve signals in our survey. Additionally, we simulate spectroscopic phase curves for the UHJ, WASP-189b. From our simulated spectroscopic phase curves, we generate mock phase-resolved emission spectra. Previously detected UHJ molecules (e.g. H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$) produce notable features in the resulting spectra, allowing for detailed atmospheric characterization to study the 3D structure of UHJ atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. For planets with hotspot phase offsets, $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be capable of detecting them both in the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. This future survey would represent the first UHJ phase curve survey with simultaneous coverage in optical and infrared wavelengths and will provide new constraints and reveal intriguing trends in these extreme environments.

TL;DR: 基于全球火球观测站1202个流星体数据，建立了10g-150kg尺寸范围内近地流星体种群的无偏模型，发现碰撞半衰期随尺寸减小而缩短，内主小行星带通过ν6共振和3:1共振主导供给1-10米直径流星体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究地球撞击流星体的种群特征及其尺寸相关的轨道元素，对于理解陨石起源和行星防御至关重要。现有动力学模型仅考虑直径大于10米的小行星，缺乏对小尺寸流星体的认识，特别是碰撞在消耗高度演化轨道流星体中的作用以及不同输送共振的相对重要性。

Method: 基于全球火球观测站观测到的1202个零星流星体数据，建立了10g-150kg尺寸范围内近地流星体种群的无偏模型，追踪它们从主小行星带动态演化到地球交叉轨道的过程。将结果与更大尺寸的近地天体模型进行对比分析。

Result: 观测到的撞击种群最佳匹配碰撞半衰期从0.6kg以上流星体的3百万年下降到更小尺寸的1百万年。内主小行星带主要通过ν6长期共振和3:1平均运动共振主导供给1-10米直径的小尺寸流星体种群。

Conclusion: 小尺寸流星体的碰撞半衰期随尺寸减小而显著缩短，内主小行星带是1-10米直径流星体的主要来源。除了碰撞外，低近日点热应力破坏等其他物理过程也可能对地球撞击流星体产生重要影响。

Abstract: The population of Earth-impacting meteoroids and its size-dependent orbital elements are key to understanding the origin of meteorites and informing on planetary defence efforts. Outstanding questions include the role of collisions in depleting meteoroids on highly evolved orbits and the relative importance of delivery resonances. Those depend on size, with current dynamical models considering only asteroids larger than 10m in diameter. Based on 1,202 sporadic meteoroids observed by the Global Fireball Observatory, we created a debiased model of the near-Earth meteoroid population in the 10g - 150kg in size (approximately 1cm - 0.5m) as they dynamically evolved from the main asteroid belt onto Earth-crossing orbits. The observed impact population is best matched with a collisional half-life decreasing from 3Myr for meteoroids of 0.6kg (7cm) or higher, to 1Myr below this size, extending to the model lower bound of 10g. Placing our results in context with near-Earth object models for larger sizes, we find that the inner main belt continues to dominate feeding the small 1m to 10m diameter population primarily via the $ν_6$ secular resonance and the 3:1J mean motion resonance. We also evaluated the potential significance of physical processes other than collisions on Earth-impacting meteoroids, such as low-perihelion disruptions from thermal stresses.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯推断方法计算成本高昂，因为行星结构模型计算量大，限制了大规模行星种群研究

Method: 用多项式混沌克里金(PCK)代理模型替代计算昂贵的物理前向模型，在MCMC采样循环中直接使用，仅需几百次前向模型评估进行训练

Conclusion: PCK代理模型框架实现了高效且统计稳健的大规模行星种群研究，相比传统机器学习方法具有显著的数据效率优势

Abstract: Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is an inverse problem often solved using Bayesian inference, but this approach is hampered by the high computational cost of planetary structure models. To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($>10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 > 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods.
