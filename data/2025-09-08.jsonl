One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter\nexoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium\ntemperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire\norbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence\nstar, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong\nwestward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime\n(ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of >100 and >10,000 respectively) and dynamical\nregime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study.\nThe extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current\nunderstanding of \"black widow\" companions, which were expected to consist of a\nwider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores."}

However, formation\nmodels indicate that composition gradients can exist. Such composition\ngradients can significantly affect the planetary thermal evolution. In\nnon-convective layers, the heat transport is governed by multiple processes. We\ninvestigate how the evolution and internal structure of Neptunes and\nsub-Neptunes is affected when considering non-convective layers and the\nsensitivity of the results on the assumed thermal conductivity. Methods. We\nsimulate the planetary evolution by considering thermal transport via\nradiation, electrons, and vibrational conductivity. We consider planetary\nmasses of 5, 10 and 15 ME, three different initial energy budgets, and two\ndifferent primordial composition profiles. We find that the assumed\nconductivity significantly affects the planetary thermal evolution. We show\nthat the commonly used conductivity assumption is inappropriate for modeling\nthis planetary type. Furthermore, we find that the inferred radii deviate by\n~20% depending on the assumed conductivity. The uncertainty on the primordial\nentropy in planets with non-convective layers leads to a difference of ~25% in\nthe radii. This shows that the theoretical uncertainties are significantly\nlarger than the observed ones, and emphasizes the importance of these\nparameters. We conclude that the characterization and modeling of\nintermediate-mass gaseous planets strongly depend on the modeling approach and\nthe model assumptions. We demonstrate that the existence of composition\ngradients significantly affects the inferred radius. We suggest that more data\non thermal conductivities, particularly for partially ionized material and\nmixtures, as well as better constraints on the primordial thermal state of such\nplanets are necessary."}

To cover all surface of a\nBiosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of\nremaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity\nthus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new\nsubstrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by\nplanetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable.

The purpose of the work is to examine the range\nof parameters for a biosphere substrate. Most importantly, Biosphere Substrate\ngravity should sustain full-scale open breathable atmosphere dense enough after\nTerraforming during the lifecycle of Planetary System. Humans can not reproduce\nin too low gravity, can not restore functionality after long exposure to\nmicrogravity. Extremely high gravity is also the limit for complex life forms\nfunctioning. Gravity is the main parameter that is the most difficult to\nchange, thus the range of celestial object sizes fitting the Biosphere\nSubstrate definition is examined first. The capability of a celestial body to\nretain breathable atmosphere during Planetary System lifecycle depends on\nplanetary magnetic field strength, thus plate tectonics is necessary,\nsufficient satellite is needed for geodynamo. As chemical composition of\nBiosphere Substrate surface hydrosphere atmosphere can be drastically adjusted\nin most cases by importing planetesimas material, this factor in most cases\ndoes not determine whether a celestial body can become a Biosphere Substrate.\nBut for water worlds where any solid material to build biological bodies and\nindustrial structures can be more than thousand kilometers deep, chemical\ncomposition can become an issue. Temperature is another important parameter, as\ncomplex life can exist in rather narrow range. For a full-scale open biosphere\ndevelopment, there must be a sufficient source of power. A Biosphere Substrate\norbit must be within technically extendable circumstellar habitable zone.
