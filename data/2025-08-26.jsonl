Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the\nanalysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a\ncompetition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of\nthe planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data\non the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data\non the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other\nhand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak\nconstraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the\nunknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water.\nOn the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable,\nespecially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was\nsufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard\nLambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble\nparameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's\nsurface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in\nreasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent\nestimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon\nsystem."}

We want to understand the photochemical evolution\nof PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the\nabsence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed\nbecause of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can\nwithstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays\nby PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise\nPAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo\nmodel, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers.\nFurthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of\nPAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small\nPAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH\nmolecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation\nand will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH\nclusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results,\nwe expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM\nabundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small\nclusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance,\nreplenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters\nremain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features\nbecause of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains."}

The\ninternal structure of TOI-2322 c is very similar to that of Earth, making it\none of the most massive planets with an Earth-like composition known."}

Manuscript GEOG-D-25-00082", "summary": "We present a new harmonic development of the long-periodic band of the Earth\ntide-generating potential (TGP). It updates the corresponding part of the\nprevious TGP expansion, KSM03 (Kudryavtsev, J. Geodesy, 77:829, 2004), and\nincludes 38 terms of period longer than $\\simeq$18 years (yr) and amplitude not\nless than $10^{-8}~{\\rm m}^2\\,{\\rm s}^{-2}$. The development is made through a\nmodified spectral analysis of the TGP numerical values tabulated over more than\n30,000 yr (13,200~BC--17,191~AD). The latest JPL NASA's long-term numerical\nephemeris DE441 (Park et al., Astron. J., 161:105, 2021) is used as the source\nof the Moon, the Sun and major planets coordinates. For comparison, the KSM03\nseries were done on the basis of an older DE406 ephemeris (Standish, JPL IOM\n312.F, 1998) and over a shorter time interval of 2000 yr (1000--3000).\n  As a result of using an extended time span several new long-periodic waves in\nthe Earth TGP are found and most of other terms are updated. In particular, a\nrelatively large term of amplitude of $3\\times 10^{-5}~{\\rm m}^2\\,{\\rm s}^{-2}$\nand period of $\\simeq$7.4~kyr is revealed. Several new waves of period close to\n18.61 yr (the period of the lunar nodal cycle, LNC) are separated from the main\nLNC term. The effect of the general precession in longitude (of\n$\\simeq$25.7~kyr period) on the Earth TGP for the first time is evaluated. As a\nresult, a number of updated TGP terms include the precession rate in their\narguments.\n  A new catalogue of the long-periodic terms in the Earth TGP spectrum in both\nstandard HW95 and KSM03 format is released."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics", "summary": "(Abridged) Giant planets are observed orbiting the primary stars of close\nbinary systems. Such planets may have formed in compact circumprimary disks,\nunder conditions much different than those around single stars. To quantify the\neffects of the strong gravitational perturbations exerted on circumprimary disk\nmaterial, the 3D dynamics of gas and dust in orbit around the primary star of a\ncompact and eccentric binary was modeled by using gamma Cephei as a\nrepresentative of a class of close binary systems. Circumprimary gas was\napproximated as an Eulerian viscous and compressible fluid. Dust grains were\nmodeled as Lagrangean particles, subjected to gravity and drag forces. Some\nmodels also include a giant planet. Models show that spiral density waves\nexcited around pericenter passage propagate toward the inner disk boundary,\nthrough a few pressure scaleheights from the midplane, inducing radial and\nvertical mixing in the gas. However, perturbations imparted to gas, both in\nterms of eccentricity and precession, are far weaker than previously estimated\nby 2D simulations. Models predict small eccentricities, <~ 0.03, and slow\nretrograde precession. The addition of a giant planet does not change the low\neccentricity state of the disk. The parameters applied to the disk would lead\nto the formation of a planet many times the mass of Jupiter, in agreement with\nsome observations. Micron to mm-size dust grains are well coupled to the gas,\nresulting in similar dynamics and statistically similar distributions of\norbital elements. The planet only affects the dust distributions locally. In\nagreement with results of recent 2D models, the lifetime of an isolated\ncircumprimary disk would be brief, ~1e5 years, due to its compact nature,\nrequiring a long-term external supply of mass to allow for the in situ\nformation of a giant planet."}

The coma\nCO2/H2O mixing ratio of $8.0\\pm1.0$ is among the highest ever observed in a\ncomet, and is 6.1-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance\nfor long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2).\nOur observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which\nmay indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation\nthan Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its\nparent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied,\nfor example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could\nsuppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO."}

A leading formation\nmechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems,\nwhich can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally\nhost moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain\ngravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both\nthe ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the\nsurvival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining\nthe statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection,\nand comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host\nplanet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an\nanalytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy\nconservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a\nminimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems\nwith finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to\ndetermine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial\nsemi-major axis. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar\nresults, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These findings offer\ninsights into the property of FFPs and inform future efforts to search for\nexomoons around them."}
