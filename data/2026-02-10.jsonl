Mandell"], "title": "A New Strategy for Using Spectroscopic Phase Curves to Characterize Non-Transiting Planets", "comment": "Submitted to AAS Journals; comments and suggestions are welcome", "summary": "We introduce a new time-series analysis strategy for combined-light exoplanet spectroscopic phase curves called the Variable Planetary Infrared Excess (VPIE) method. VPIE can be used to extract information about the planetary flux contribution without the need for the planet to transit, or use of a stellar spectral model. VPIE utilizes a linear combination of a small set of individual spectra to produce an empirical model of the stellar contribution at each time step, thereby normalizing each spectrum and leaving only an imprint of the planet's flux in the residual data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VPIE through simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of three known exoplanet orbiting late-type M stars: the warm giant TOI-519 b, the warm sub-Neptune GJ 876 d, and the temperate super-Earth Proxima Centauri b. Our results indicate that though VPIE loses sensitivity for very high redistribution values, it can successfully distinguish between various atmospheric circulation regimes (zero, moderate, or high heat redistribution) and constrain planetary radii for non-unity day-night temperature ratios. While performance for cooler targets may be limited by JWST spectroscopic capabilities at longer wavelengths, future VPIE improvements or new instrumentation could enable characterization of potentially habitable planets. VPIE offers a promising new framework for pulling back the veil on the population of non-transiting planets around nearby M-stars that are otherwise inaccessible to current techniques."}

We conducted near-infrared spectroscopic observations of C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2023 February 9. Our measurements securely detected fluorescent emission from H$_2$O, CO, OCS, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. For each instrumental setting we took exposures with the slit oriented parallel and also perpendicular to the projected Sun-comet vector, thereby enabling a test of the spatial distributions of these molecules. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species. Our measurements found that molecular abundances in C/2022 E3 were depleted compared to their average values in Oort cloud comets with the exception of OCS, which was consistent. The H$_2$O production rate varied significantly and was likely tied to nucleus rotation effects. Measurements at the two slit orientations showed distinct column density and rotational temperature profiles for H$_2$O. Peak temperatures occurred off-nucleus and slower cooling was present in the anti-sunward hemisphere, consistent with the presence of icy grain sublimation in the coma."}

Population studies of disks large-sample size surveys show that substructures, and their rapid formation, are needed to reproduce the observed spectral indices. Moreover, they enable the simultaneous reproduction of the observed spectral index and size-luminosity distributions. This study aims to investigate the necessity of substructures and predict their characteristics to reproduce gas-to-dust size ratios observed in the Lupus star-forming region. We performed a population synthesis study of gas and dust evolution in disks using a two-population model (two-pop-py) and the DustPy code. We considered the effects of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, transport, and external photoevaporation. The simulated population distributions were obtained by post-processing the resulting disk profiles of surface density, maximum grain size, and disk temperature. Although substructures help reduce the discrepancy between simulated and observed disk gas-to-dust size ratios; even when accounting for external photoevaporation, they do not fully resolve it. Only specific initial conditions in disks undergoing viscous evolution with external photoevaporation can reproduce the observations, highlighting a fine-tuning problem. While substructured disks reproduce dust size and spectral index, they tend to overestimate gas radii. The results ultimately highlight the main challenge of simultaneously reproducing gas and dust sizes. One possible explanation is that the outermost substructure is linked to the disk truncation radius, which determines the gas radius, or that substructures are frequent enough to always be near the gas outer radius."}

Out of the sample of 11, we find support for companions in seven systems, with significant detections in three. These systems are: HD 142527, where we clearly detect the known low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B; AB Aurigae, where we detect a low-mass stellar or sub-stellar companion; and MWC 758, where we detect a likely sub-stellar companion. We also find strong evidence of companions to HD 97048 and UX Tau A, and moderate evidence for companions to HD 100546 and CQ Tau. In the four systems with non-detections, we find no evidence for companions more massive than $\\sim$6 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 3 au for HD 100453, nor for companions more massive than $\\sim$2 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 2 au for TW Hya. We also find no evidence for stellar mass companions with semi-major axes between $\\sim$3 and $\\sim$25 au for both HD 34282 and RY Lup. In addition to our fiducial model, we perform cross validation between astrometry sources. By comparing results across models, we find tentative evidence of a short timescale excess astrometric noise that may impact some protoplanetary disk systems. We conclude with predictions for the prospects of making dynamical mass constraints on protoplanets in protoplanetary disk systems with Gaia data release 4 using detailed simulations of Gaia DR4 data of PDS 70 and WISPIT 2."}

Reshaping the local accretion environment", "comment": "Accepted to A&A, 17 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "The existence of winds is among the uncertainties related to the growth of giant planets. Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \\texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth."}

The Spitzer mid-IR photometry suggests that the temperature is as cold as 350K, making it one of the coldest directly imaged exoplanets. In this paper, we present the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam) F150W2, F200W, F356W, and F444W broadband photometry and a 3--5\\um Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRSpec) G395M spectrum obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

Our retrieval results reveal bounded abundances of H$_2$S, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, H$_2$O, and CH$_4$. We present a new chemical analysis framework that utilizes retrieved abundances to measure altitude-dependent eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{\\mathrm zz}$) at multiple quenched pressures. We find that the eddy diffusion coefficients decrease from around $10^4$ to $10^2$ $\\rm cm^2/s$ as the atmospheric pressure decreases from from 50 to 20 bars.

It is currently under review at Space Science Reviews", "summary": "The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Context. The origin of the petrologic diversity observed in ordinary chondrites (OCs), the most common meteorites on Earth, remains debated. Competing models invoke either depth-dependent sampling of a single thermally stratified (\"onion-shell\") parent body or contributions from multiple distinct parent bodies. Aims. We aim to determine which of the two models is preferred for LL chondrites. These are unique among OCs in exhibiting a bimodal petrologic distribution, with most meteorites being LL3 or LL6. Methods. We compare the spectral and mineralogical properties of LL chondrites and corresponding LL-chondrite-like near-Earth objects (NEOs) with their possible sources in the main asteroid belt. We also model the thermal histories of the proposed parent bodies, based on revised estimates of parent-body sizes. Results. The spectral and mineralogical diversity of LL chondrites is consistent with contributions from the bright, S-type component of the Nysa family (NysaS) and the Flora family, with NysaS supplying mainly low-petrologic-type material and Flora higher-grade material. Unequilibrated, LL3 chondrites appear to originate exclusively from NysaS. Similarly, LL-chondrite-like NEOs form two distinct subpopulations consistent with origins in these same families. Conclusions. Our results favour multiple parent bodies for LL chondrites. The petrologic differences between the NysaS and Flora parent bodies indicate that planetesimal accretion within the OC reservoir extended over 0.5-0.7 Myr."}
