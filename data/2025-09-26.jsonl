Characterizing the heavy element (everything\nother than hydrogen and helium) content of giant planets provides important\nclues about their provenance. Using thermal evolution models with updated H-He\nEOS and atmospheric boundary condition that varies with envelope metallicity,\nwe quantify the bulk heavy element content of 147 warm ($< 1000$ K) giant\nplanets with well-measured masses and radii, more than tripling the sample size\nstudied in Thorngren et al. 2016. These measurements reveal that the\npopulation's heavy element mass follows the relation $M_{\\rm Z} = M_{\\rm core}\n+ f_Z (M_{\\rm p} - M_{\\rm core})$, with $M_{\\rm core} = 14.7^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$\nEarth masses (M$_\\oplus$), $f_Z = 0.09 \\pm 0.01$, and an astrophysical scatter\nof $0.66 \\pm 0.08 \\times M_Z$. The classical core-accretion scenario ($Z_{\\rm\np} = 1$ at 10 M$_\\oplus$ and $Z_{\\rm p} = 0.5$ at 20 M$_\\oplus$) is\ninconsistent with the population. At low planet masses ($<< 150$ M$_\\oplus$),\n$M_{\\rm Z} \\sim M_{\\rm core}$ and as a result, $Z_{\\rm p} = M_{\\rm Z} / M_{\\rm\np}$ declines linearly with $M_{\\rm p}$. However, bulk metallicity does not\ncontinue to decline with planet mass and instead flattens out at $f_Z \\sim\n0.09$ ($\\sim 7 \\times$ solar metallicity). When normalized by stellar\nmetallicity, $Z_{\\rm p} / Z_\\star$ flattens out at $3.3 \\pm 0.5$ at high planet\nmasses. This explicitly shows that giant planets continue to accrete material\nenriched in heavy elements during the gas accretion phase."}

Re-submitted to AAS journals after\n  addressing reviewer comments", "summary": "The evolution and structure of sub-Neptunes may be strongly influenced by\ninteractions between the outer gaseous envelope of the planet and a surface\nmagma ocean. However, given the wide variety of permissible interior structures\nof these planets, it is unclear whether conditions at the envelope-mantle\nboundary will always permit a molten silicate layer, or whether some\nsub-Neptunes might instead host a solid silicate surface. In this work, we use\ninternal structure modeling to perform an extensive exploration of surface\nconditions within the sub-Neptune population across a range of bulk and\natmospheric parameters. We find that a significant portion of the population\nmay lack present-day magma oceans. In particular, planets with a high\natmospheric mean molecular weight and large envelope mass fraction are likely\nto instead have a solid silicate surface, since the pressure at the\nenvelope-mantle boundary is high enough that the silicates will be in solid\npost-perovskite phase. This result is particularly relevant given recent\ninferences of high-mean molecular weight atmospheres from JWST observations of\nseveral sub-Neptunes. We apply this approach to a number of sub-Neptunes with\nexisting or upcoming JWST observations, and find that in almost all cases, a\nrange of solutions exist which do not possess a present-day magma ocean. Our\nanalysis provides critical context for interpreting sub-Neptunes and their\natmospheres."}

We for the\nfirst time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide\nsolutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and\nsuccessfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and\npropagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion\ninteractions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally\neliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging\nto suppress in numerical simulations.

Radiation hydrodynamics and suitable cooling prescriptions", "comment": "12 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to A&A, comments are welcome!", "summary": "The ring and gap structures found in observed protoplanetary disks are often\nattributed to embedded gap-opening planets and typically modeled with\nsimplified thermodynamics in the 2D, thin disk approximation. However, it has\nbeen shown that radiative cooling and meridional processes play key roles in\nplanet-disk interaction, though their computational cost has limited their\nexploration. We investigate the differences between 2D and 3D models of\ngap-opening planets while also comparing thermodynamical frameworks ranging\nfrom locally isothermal to fully radiative. We also compare simplified cooling\nrecipes to fully radiative models in an effort to motivate the inclusion of\nradiative effects in future modeling even in a parametrized manner. We perform\nhydrodynamical simulations in both 2D and 3D, and then compare the angular\nmomentum deposition by planetary spirals to assess gap opening efficiency. We\nrepeat comparisons with different thermodynamical treatments: locally\nisothermal, adiabatic, local $\\beta$ cooling, and fully radiative including\nradiative diffusion. We find that 2D models are able to capture the essential\nphysics of gap opening with remarkable accuracy, even when including full\nradiation transport in both cases. Simple cooling prescriptions can capture the\ntrends found in fully radiative models, albeit slightly overestimating gap\nopening efficiency near the planet. Inherently 3D effects such as vertical\nflows that cannot be captured in 2D can explain the differences between the two\napproaches, but do not impact gap opening significantly. Our findings encourage\nthe use of models that include radiative processes in the study of planet-disk\ninteraction, even with simplified yet physically motivated cooling\nprescriptions in lieu of full radiation transport. This is particularly\nimportant in the context of substructure-inducing planets in the ALMA-sensitive\ndisk regions (>10 au)."}

To investigate the degree to which this might have occurred we\ncompare the composition of individual comets to that of the well-studied\nprotostellar region IRAS 16293-2422B. We show that the observed molecular\nabundance ratios in several comets correlate well with those observed in the\nprotostellar source. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cometary\nabundances are identical to protostellar. We find the abundance ratios of many\nmolecules present in comets are enhanced compared to their protostellar\ncounterparts. For COH-molecules, the data suggest higher abundances relative to\nmethanol of more complex species, e.g. HCOOH, CH3CHO, and HCOOCH3, are found in\ncomets. For N-bearing molecules, the ratio of nitriles relative to CH3CN --\nHC3N/CH3CN and HCN/CH3CN -- tend to be enhanced. The abundances of cometary SO\nand SO2 relative to H2S are enhanced, whereas OCS/H2S is reduced. Using a\nsubset of comets with a common set of observed molecules we suggest a possible\nmeans of determining the relative degree to which they retain interstellar\nices. This analysis suggests that over 84% of COH-bearing molecules can be\nexplained by the protostellar composition. The possible fraction inherited from\nthe protostellar region is lower for N-molecules at only 26--74%. While this is\nstill speculative, especially since few comets have large numbers of observed\nmolecules, it provides a possible route for determining the relative degree to\nwhich comets contain disk-processed material."}

However, constraining orbits at\nthese separations has been challenging because of sparse orbital coverage and\ndegeneracies in the orbital parameters. We use existing high-resolution\nspectroscopic measurements from CRIRES+ (R ~ 100000), astrometric data from\nSPHERE, NACO, and ALMA, and new high-precision GRAVITY astrometry to refine the\norbit of GQ Lup B, a ~30 M_J companion at ~100 au, in a system that also hosts\na circumstellar disk and a wide companion, GQ Lup C. Including radial velocity\ndata significantly improves orbital constraints by breaking the degeneracy\nbetween inclination and eccentricity that affects astrometry-only fits for\nlong-period companions. This work is among the first to combine high-precision\nastrometry with the companion's relative radial velocity to achieve improved\norbital constraints. The eccentricity is refined from e = 0.47 (+0.14, -0.16)\nwith GRAVITY alone to e = 0.35 (+0.10, -0.09) when RVs and GRAVITY data are\ncombined. The orbit is misaligned by 63 (+6, -14) deg relative to the\ncircumstellar disk and 52 (+19, -24) deg relative to the host star spin axis,\nand is more consistent (34 (+6, -13) deg) with the inclination of the wide\ntertiary companion GQ Lup C disk. These results support a formation scenario\nfor GQ Lup B consistent with cloud fragmentation and highlight the power of\ncombining companion RV constraints with interferometric astrometry to probe the\ndynamics and formation of wide-orbit substellar companions."}

Fernandez"], "title": "The depletion of the asteroid belt and the impact history of the Earth", "comment": null, "summary": "We have evaluated the rate at which the asteroid belt is losing material, and\nhow it splits between macroscopic bodies and meteoritic dust. The mass loss\nprocess is due to the injection of asteroid fragments into unstable dynamical\nregions, associated to mean-motion resonances with Jupiter, Saturn and Mars or\nsecular resonances, from where they are scattered either to the region of the\nterrestrial planets or to the vicinity of Jupiter's orbit. Asteroid fragments\nthat do not escape from the belt are ground down by mutual collisions to\nmeteoritic dust. Under the assumption that 25\\% of the zodiacal dust mass is of\nasteroidal origin, we find that the asteroid belt is currently losing a\nfraction of about $\\mu_o \\simeq 8.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ Ma$^{-1}$ of its\ncollisionally-active mass (without the primordial objects Ceres, Vesta and\nPallas), about 20\\% as macroscopic bodies, and 80\\% as dust particles that feed\nthe zodiacal dust cloud. Extrapolation of the current mass loss rate to the\npast suggests only a moderate increase of the asteroid belt mass and the mass\nloss rate around 3.0 - 3.5 Ga ago (by about 50\\% and a factor of two\nrespectively). Yet, should the computed $\\mu_o$ be somewhat underestimated\nowing to the different uncertainties associated to its computation, the\nextrapolation to the past would lead to quite different results. For instance,\na moderate increase in the computed $\\mu_o$, say by a factor of three, would\nlead to an exponential increase of the asteroid mass and mass loss rate about\n3.5 Ga ago. A greater asteroid mass loss rate in the past should be correlated\nwith a more intense impact rate of the Earth, Moon and the other terrestrial\nplanets, which is indeed what suggests the geologic record (Hartmann 2007)."}

One key process governing this evolution is\natmospheric evaporation by stellar X-ray and EUV emission (collectively, XUV).\nAs such, the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres is closely tied to the\nevolution of the host star's magnetic activity. Many studies have modelled the\ncombined evolution of exoplanet atmospheres and their host stars. However, to\ndate, the impact of the host star's metallicity on stellar activity/exoplanet\natmosphere evolution has not been explored. In this work, we investigate how\nstellar metallicity affects the rotation and activity evolution of solar-like\nstars as well as the corresponding exoplanet atmospheric evolution. We\nreconfirm previous results that metal-rich stars spin down more rapidly than\nmetal-poor stars. We also find that the XUV flux that an exoplanet in the\nhabitable zone of its host star receives is larger when the host star is more\nmetal-rich. As such, the atmospheres of exoplanets in the habitable zones of\nmetal-rich stars are evaporated more rapidly than exoplanets in the habitable\nzones of metal-poor stars. Lastly, we find that the atmospheric evolution is\nmost sensitive to the host star metallicity when the host star has a higher\nmass. In the highest mass solar-stars, the metallicity can have a larger\ninfluence on the atmospheric evolution than the initial rotation period of the\nstar."}
