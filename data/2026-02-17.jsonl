Although largely agnostic to the details of how interplanetary life might operate (e.g., via technology or by utilizing organism traits that are, as of now, unknown to us), some assumptions must be made about energy harvesting, orbital mobility costs, radiation risks, and resource requirements. A multi-modal figure of merit is developed for evaluating an interplanetary habitable zone (IHZ). An agent-based model is also developed to simulate the dispersal of interplanetary life in a planetary system and characterize the IHZ. For the solar system, resource weightings between planetary bodies dictate many overall behaviors, including the sequence of migration from Earth to the Moon, Mars, and asteroid belt. Comparisons with the Trappist-1 exoplanetary system also point to critical sensitivities in the balance between resource availability and risk or cost factors (e.g., radiation risks and orbital Delta-v costs) that determine the structure of an IHZ. Results suggest that our solar system may have an inherent, and significant, advantage for a space-faring species over a system like Trappist-1. This modeling approach may also have application to emerging space economies in our own solar system."}

However, obtaining disc mass measurements remain challenging, since it is not possible to directly detect H$_2$, and CO abundance ratios are poorly constrained. Dynamical measurements of the disc mass are now possible, but they are not suited to all discs since the measurements typically require well-behaved emission surfaces. A long-standing method is to obtain continuum flux measurements from the dust emission, and convert to a total disc mass by assumption of the dust-to-gas mass ratio, $ε$. This quantity is poorly constrained in protoplanetary discs. %\nWe investigate the impact of $ε$ on the morphology of planet-containing hydrodynamical simulations of dusty protoplanetary accretion discs, and suggest that if a planet mass estimate can be obtained, then disc morphology could be used to constrain $ε$ in observed systems relative to each other, improving the total disc mass estimates of protoplanetary discs."}

Radii of singles and multis", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 12 pages. 9 figures. The abstract is abridged", "summary": "The discovered planets in apparent single-planet systems (singles) and those in systems with multiple detected planets (multis) exhibit a rich diversity of physical and orbital properties. We investigate the differences and similarities between 1730 singles and 1522 multis in a catalogue of confirmed transiting planets orbiting main-sequence stars with spectral classes ranging from late-M to late-F. After we removed the hot Jupiters, the planet types and their fractional numbers were similar for the multis and singles hosted by FGK-type stars. Furthermore, the median radii of both the singles and the multis increase with host star temperature already from late- to early-type M dwarfs and further up to F stars. Our analyses show that the singles are larger on average than the multis in our F, G, K, and M samples. However, after we excluded the hot Jupiters, the radius distributions of the singles and multis orbiting FGK stars are statistically indistinguishable, particularly at $R < 4\\, R_\\oplus$. In the FGK sample, we also identified an unexpected and significant overabundance of multis, compared to singles, at radii of $\\approx1.4-1.6\\, R_\\oplus$. For the early- and late-type M samples, our work indicates that the multis are smaller on average than the singles and that the radius distributions of the multis and singles are different, except for the planets with $R < 4\\, R_\\oplus$ hosted by early-type M dwarfs. Nevertheless, these results for the two M samples are inconclusive because the sample sizes of 167 and 101 planets are limited. In conclusion, our analyses reveal that the singles and multis, excluding the hot Jupiters, orbiting FGK stars are overall consistent with originating from the same underlying population based on their planet types and radii. This interpretation is, however, not applicable within the region of the overabundance of multis identified in this work."}

Detecting complex organic molecules (COMs), essential for prebiotic chemistry, is crucial to assessing their potential. Though COMs remain undetected on these moons, ESA's JUICE and NASA's Europa Clipper missions aim to fill this gap with their science payloads. This study explores the formation and transport of COMs within Jupiter's circumplanetary disk (CPD), a critical environment for the formation of the Galilean moons. Using a time-dependent model that couples the evolving CPD structure with the dynamics of icy particles of varying sizes and release times, we assess two primary COM formation pathways: thermal processing of ices and UV photochemistry. The results indicate that heating, particularly of NH3:CO2 ices, occurs efficiently before substantial irradiation, making it the dominant pathway for COM formation in the Jovian CPD. However, the relative efficiencies of these two processes are governed by particle density, disk viscosity, accretion rate, and UV flux, which collectively determine drift timescales and exposure to favorable thermodynamic environments. Existing models indicate that Europa's accretion was relatively cold and prolonged, possibly allowing some COMs to survive incorporation, whereas Ganymede and Callisto likely formed under even cooler conditions conducive to preserving COM-rich material. These results highlight the potential inheritance of complex organics by the Galilean moons and offer a framework for interpreting upcoming compositional data from JUICE and Europa Clipper."}

We analysed eight CRIRES+ transit datasets covering the K band (1.90-2.45 microns) at a resolving power of R ~ 100,000. We used the SysRem algorithm to correct for telluric and stellar contributions and employed the cross-correlation technique with templates from petitRADTRANS to search for H2O, CH4, and CO2. Injection-recovery tests across a grid of metallicities (Z) and cloud-deck pressures (pc) were performed to quantify detection limits. We also generated predictions for ANDES observations using end-to-end simulated datasets with EXoPLORE. We detect no significant H2O, CH4, or CO2 signatures. Injection-recovery tests show that such non-detections exclude atmospheres with low-altitude clouds and moderate or low metallicities. CH4 yields the tightest empirical limits, with CO2 unexpectedly ruling out intermediate metallicities (~ 100xsolar) with clouds deeper due to its rapidly rising opacity in compressed, high-Z atmospheres. Our constraints are in line with either a high-Z or a high-altitude aerosol layer, in agreement with recent JWST inferences. The combined analysis of eight CRIRES+ datasets provides the most stringent high-resolution constraints on the atmospheric properties of GJ 1214 b to date. Simulations of a single transit observed with ANDES on the ELT predict modest improvements for H2O, a substantially expanded detectable region for CH4, and the strongest gains for CO2, making the latter a particularly effective tracer for characterising high-metallicity atmospheres in sub-Neptunes."}

Submitted to Icarus", "summary": "The origin of the red colouration in Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is a long-standing question in planetary science. While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\\times10^{-12}$-$7\\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\\mathrm{trop}}\\lesssim 1.5\\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $μ$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution."}

However, these elevation products were generated with a proprietary pipeline and have not been publicly released. We present a 0.30 m/pixel digital elevation model (DEM) of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram landing site using a fully open workflow based on ISIS, the Ames Stereo Pipeline, and ALE, achieving sub-meter resolution comparable to mission-reported products.\n  The reconstruction covers 2.18 x 2.24 km with 91.2% valid pixel coverage, 8.1 cm median triangulation error, and 40-50 cm relative vertical precision. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover are individually resolved. Geodetic alignment to an LROC NAC stereo DEM achieves approximately 30 m horizontal accuracy; pixel-wise validation at 3 m resolution confirms negligible vertical bias (median dz = +0.28 m) and robust dispersion (NMAD = 2.88 m). Stable OHRC stereo convergence requires Community Sensor Model (CSM) camera models; the legacy ISIS camera model failed across two independent sites.\n  At 0.30 m, these DEMs complement LROC NAC DTMs (approximately 1 m), resolving sub-meter hazards below the NAC detection threshold. Applied to the extensive OHRC south polar archive, this methodology provides independent capability for hazard mapping and landing site analysis for upcoming missions including Chandrayaan-4, LUPEX, and Artemis."}
