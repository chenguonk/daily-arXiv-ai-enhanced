### [1] [Dynamical Excitation as a probe of planetary origins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01332)
*Brad M. S. Hansen,Tze-Yeung Yu,Neel Nagarajan,Yasuhiro Hasegawa*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过数值模拟展示了在具有磁化内边界的原行星盘中，致密行星系统的迁移演化过程，解释了观测到的行星间距分布和残余动力学激发特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释观测中致密行星系统为何只有少量共振系统存活，以及行星间距和残余偏心率的分布特征，需要更准确地模拟原行星盘内边界结构。

Method: 使用数值模拟研究行星在具有磁化内边界的原行星盘中的迁移演化，考虑了恒星磁场与盘的相互作用导致的内边界渐变结构。

Result: 模拟显示最终行星周期比分布中只有小部分共振系统存活，与观测一致；行星架构在原行星盘阶段结束时就基本形成；行星对在气体盘消散期间的分离会激发偏心率。

Conclusion: 观测到的致密行星系统间距和残余动力学激发可以通过在原行星盘中迁移来重现，前提是内边界模型为渐变过渡而非锐利边界，这种效应可通过考虑恒星磁场扩散到盘中来实现。

Abstract: We present a set of numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of
compact planetary systems migrating in a protoplanetary disk whose inner edge
is sculpted by the interaction with the stellar magnetic field, as described in
Yu et al. (2023). We demonstrate that the resulting final distribution of
neighbouring planet period ratios contains only a small surviving fraction of
resonant systems, in accordance with observations. The resulting planetary
architectures are largely in place by the end of the protoplanetary disk phase
(within a few Myr), and do not require significant later dynamical evolution.
The divergence of planetary pairs during gas disk dispersal also leads to the
excitation of eccentricities when pairs cross mean motion resonances in a
divergent fashion. The resulting distribution of remnant free eccentricities is
consistent with the values inferred from the observation of transit durations
and transit timing variations. We furthermore demonstrate that this conclusion
is not significantly altered by tides, assuming standard values for tidal
dissipation in Earth or Neptune-class planets. These results demonstrate that
the observed spacing and residual dynamical excitation of compact planetary
systems can be reproduced by migration through a protoplanetary disk, as long
as the inner disk boundary is modelled as a gradual rollover, instead of a
sharp transition. Such an effect can be achieved when the model accounts for
the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk. The resulting
divergence of planetary pairs during the magnetospheric rebound phase breaks
the resonant chains, resulting in a better match to observations than disk
models with more traditional inner boundaries.

TL;DR: 通过18厘米OH脉泽观测研究彗星12P/Pons-Brooks的OH产生率和水分子的膨胀速度，发现在接近近日点过程中OH产生率逐渐增加，膨胀速度与经验公式一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学彗星数据库广泛但射电数据库有限，OH脉泽观测可以确定彗星的OH产生率和水分子膨胀速度，揭示周期性彗星12P/Pons-Brooks的物理性质。

Method: 使用泰国国家射电望远镜40米天线在2024年3月22日、27日和29日对彗星12P/Pons-Brooks进行1665和1667 MHz OH脉泽观测。

Result: 成功探测到OH脉泽发射，测得OH产生率分别为4.28±0.30×10²⁹ s⁻¹、5.21±0.42×10²⁹ s⁻¹和3.36±0.43×10²⁹ s⁻¹；水分子膨胀速度分别为1.55±0.14 km/s、1.55±0.35 km/s和2.02⁺⁰·⁴⁷₋₀·₄₅ km/s。

Conclusion: 12P/Pons-Brooks彗星的OH产生率在几天时间尺度上有波动，但在接近近日点的长期尺度上逐渐增加；所有膨胀速度测量结果与经验公式在误差范围内一致。

Abstract: Although the optical cometary database is extensive, the radio database is
limited. The 18-cm OH maser observations of comets allow us to determine (i)
the production rate of OH ($Q_{\rm{OH}}$) and (ii) the water expansion
velocity, for each comet. To reveal the physical properties of the periodic
comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, we conducted the OH maser observations of the comet
using the 40-m TNRT (Thai National Radio Telescope) on March 22nd, 27th and
29th, 2024 before the perihelion passage on April 21st, 2024. We successfully
detected 1665 and 1667 MHz OH maser emissions from the comet. The average OH
production rates of 12P/Pons-Brooks were determined as 4.28$\pm$0.30 $\times$
10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, 5.21$\pm$0.42 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, and
3.36$\pm$0.43 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$ for March 22nd, 27th and 29th,
respectively. Combining our results with previous estimates, we find that the
OH production rate of 12P/Pons-Brooks shows some fluctuations on timescales of
a few days, but gradually increases on longer timescales as the comet
approaches the last perihelion. The water expansion velocities of the comet
were determined to be 1.55$\pm$0.14 km s$^{-1}$, 1.55$\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$, and
2.02$^{+0.47}_{-0.45}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the observations on March 22nd, 27th and
29th, respectively. The reason why the errors are different is because the
signal to noise ratio is different for each OH maser emission. All expansion
velocities are consistent with the individual results of the heuristic law
(Tseng et al. 2007) within errors.

TL;DR: 分析了五个长周期TESS候选系外行星，验证了三个为真实行星（两个暖土星和一个暖亚海王星），另外两个为食双星，填补了暖行星参数空间的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究长周期系外行星，这些目标位于周期-半径参数空间中相对未被探索的区域，为行星形成和迁移提供了宝贵的原始探测机会。

Method: 结合TESS光度测量与南极系外行星搜寻计划（ASTEP）的高精度地面观测，使用高分辨率散斑成像、光谱分析和SED拟合来表征系统，应用MCMC采样进行联合建模。

Result: 验证了TOI-4507 b（104天）、TOI-3457 b（32.6天）和TOI-707 b（52.8天）为真实行星，TOI-2404和TOI-4404为食双星。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于填补暖行星稀疏区域，证明ASTEP作为长周期系统地面后续观测仪器的有效性，暖行星是行星演化的关键示踪剂。

Abstract: We present the analysis of five long-period TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs),
each with orbital periods exceeding one month. Initially identified by the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we extensively monitored these
targets with the Antarctic Search for Transiting Exoplanets (ASTEP), supported
by other facilities in the TESS Follow-Up (TFOP) network. These targets occupy
a relatively underexplored region of the period-radius parameter space,
offering valuable primordial probes for planetary formation and migration as
warm planets better maintain their evolutionary fingerprints. To characterise
these systems, we leverage high-resolution speckle imaging to search for nearby
stellar companions, and refine stellar parameters using both reconnaissance
spectroscopy and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We combine TESS
photometry with high-precision ground-based observations from ASTEP, and when
available, include additional photometry and radial velocity data. We apply
statistical validation to assess the planetary nature of each candidate and use
to jointly model the photometric and spectroscopic datasets with Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to derive robust posterior distributions. With
this, we validate the planetary nature of three TOIs, including the two warm
Saturns TOI-4507 b (104 d) and TOI-3457 b (32.6 d), as well as the warm
sub-Neptune TOI-707 b (52.8 d). The remaining two candidates are identified as
eclipsing binaries, namely TOI-2404 and TOI-4404. These results help populate
the sparse regime of warm planets, which serve as key tracers of planetary
evolution, and demonstrate ASTEP's effectiveness as a ground-based follow-up
instrument for long-period systems.

### [4] [Impact Plasma Amplification of the Ancient Mercury Magnetic Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01975)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过模拟水星Caloris盆地形成事件，发现撞击产生的等离子体可以将古代磁层场放大至13μT，并通过冲击压力波记录为冲击剩磁，这可以解释水星表面观测到的剩磁现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水星表面观测到剩磁现象，但古代磁场强度存在很大不确定性（0.2-50μT），需要解释古代磁场如何被记录在岩石中。

Method: 使用撞击流体动力学和磁流体动力学模拟，模拟Caloris大小盆地（直径约1550公里）形成事件。

Result: 古代磁层场（0.5-0.9μT）可被等离子体放大至约13μT，并通过冲击压力波在盆地对跖点记录为冲击剩磁，产生约5nT的壳层磁场。

Conclusion: 撞击等离子体放大过程对无大气天体壳层磁化有重要贡献，在通过壳层异常测量重建发电机历史时应予以考虑。

Abstract: Spacecraft measurements of Mercury indicate it has a core dynamo with a
surface field of 200-800 nT. These data also indicate that the crust contains
remanent magnetization likely produced by an ancient magnetic field. The
inferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield
strengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field
much stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has
demonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently
amplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced
pressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock
remanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter)
formation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field
(~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13
uT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode.
Such magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude
antipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo.
Furthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter
basins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus)
could impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to
the overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma
amplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies
and should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal
anomaly measurements.

TL;DR: 对K2-19系统中两颗海王星质量行星的10年观测数据分析，修正了先前的高偏心率估计，发现更低的偏心率值，更符合标准形成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究显示K2-19系统中行星具有高偏心率(约0.20)，这与标准行星形成模型不符，因此需要更长的观测基线来更精确地约束偏心率值。

Method: 使用10年凌星数据的测光动力学分析，结合傅里叶分析来匹配凌星时间变化的频率和振幅，以获得行星质量估计。

Result: 确认了之前的质量估计(30.8±1.3 M_E和11.1±0.4 M_E)，但将偏心率降低到0.04±0.02和0.07±0.02，更符合标准形成模型。发现先前高偏心率是由于一次在黄昏时观测的凌星数据误差导致。

Conclusion: 修正后的低偏心率值更符合核心吸积形成模型，并发现了一个可能的外部行星候选体。

Abstract: The star K2-19 hosts a pair of Neptunian planets deep inside the 3:2
resonance. They induce strong transit-timing variations with two incommensurate
frequencies. Previous photodynamical modeling of 3.3 years of transit and
radial velocity data produced mass estimates of 32.4 +/- 1.7 M_E and 10.8 +/-
0.6 M_E for planets b and c, respectively, and corresponding eccentricity
estimates of 0.20 +/- 0.03 and 0.21 +/- 0.03. These high eccentricities raise
questions about the formation origin of the system, and this motivated us to
extend the observing baseline in an attempt to better constrain their values.
We present a photodynamical analysis of 10 years of transit data that confirms
the previous mass estimates (30.8 +/- 1.3 M_E and 11.1 +/- 0.4 M_E), but
reduces the median eccentricities to 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 0.07 +/- 0.02 for b and
c, respectively. These values are more consistent with standard formation
models, but still involve nonzero free eccentricity. The previously reported
high eccentricities appear to be due to a single transit for which measurements
taken at twilight mimicked ingress. This resulted in a 12-minute error in the
midtransit time. The data that covered 1.3 and 5 so-called super and resonant
periods were used to match a Fourier analysis of the transit-timing variation
signal with simple analytic expressions for the frequencies and amplitudes to
obtain planet mass estimates within 2% of the median photodynamical values,
regardless of the eccentricities. Theoretical details of the analysis are
presented in a companion paper. Additionally, we identified a possible planet
candidate situated exterior to the b-c pair. Finally, in contrast to a previous
study, our internal structure modeling of K2-19 b yields a metal mass fraction
that is consistent with core accretion.

TL;DR: 通过三维磁流体动力学模拟，研究发现水星在37亿年前存在比现在强10-100倍的磁场（至少2000 nT），排除了太阳风反馈和热电机制驱动发电机的可能性，支持由增强的能量通量驱动强核心对流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水星是太阳系中除地球外唯一具有活跃发电机磁场的类地行星，其37亿年前的地壳表现出强烈磁化，但磁化源和磁场强度未知。

Method: 使用三维磁流体动力学模拟古代太阳风与行星磁场的相互作用，并结合热冷却和磁化模型。

Result: 地壳磁化很可能由至少2000 nT的表面磁场产生，可能超过10000 nT，比当前磁场强10-100倍。

Conclusion: 如此强的磁场排除了太阳风反馈和热电机制驱动发电机的可能性，支持过去发电机由增强的能量通量驱动强核心对流。

Abstract: Mercury is the only other terrestrial planet in the solar system with an
active dynamo magnetic field (~200 nT at the equatorial surface). Furthermore,
Mercury's ~3.9-3.7 billion-year old (Ga) crust is strongly magnetized (~10 nT
at ~30-km altitude), indicating the presence of a past dynamo. However, the
source and strength of the field that magnetized this crust are unknown. To
address this, we performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
the ancient solar wind interaction with the planetary field and coupled them
with thermal cooling and magnetization models. We show that the crustal
magnetization was likely produced by a surface field of at least ~2,000 nT,
likely >10,000 nT (i.e., ~10x or ~50-100x stronger than at present). Such
strong fields likely exclude both the solar wind feedback and thermoelectric
mechanisms for driving the dynamo at 3.7 Ga ago. Instead, our results are
compatible with the past dynamo being powered by an enhanced energy flux that
drove strong core convection.

TL;DR: 该研究通过更新2D时间依赖的盘化学模型，探索了硫在原生行星盘中的分子形式，发现高C/O比可以解释CS的普遍存在和SO的缺失，初始硫形态对盘下层冰丰度有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硫是地球生命的关键元素，在系外行星和彗星中检测到含硫分子，需要了解硫从分子云到行星的演化过程，特别是硫在原生行星盘中的分子形式。

Method: 更新Fogel等人(2011)的2D时间依赖盘化学模型框架，纳入新的硫物种和数百个硫反应，研究不同挥发性硫丰度、C/O比、初始硫分子形式和宇宙射线电离率的影响。

Result: 高C/O比可以解释CS在盘中的普遍存在和SO检测的缺失，初始硫形态显著影响盘下层冰丰度，对彗星形成和JWST观测有重要意义。

Conclusion: 硫在原生行星盘中的化学演化受多种因素影响，特别是C/O比和初始硫形态，这对理解行星形成过程中硫的分布和彗星组成有重要启示。

Abstract: Sulfur is a critical element to life on Earth, and with detections of
sulfur-bearing molecules in exoplanets and comets, questions arise as to how
sulfur is incorporated into planets in the first place. In order to understand
sulfur's journey from molecular clouds to planets, we need to understand the
molecular forms that sulfur takes in protoplanetary disks, where the rotational
emission from sulfur-bearing molecules in the gas phase indicates a very low
abundance. To address this question, we have updated the 2D time-dependent disk
chemical modeling framework of Fogel et al. (2011) to incorporate several new
sulfur species and hundreds of new sulfur reactions from the literature.
Specifically, we investigate the main molecular forms that sulfur takes in a
disk orbiting a solar mass young T Tauri star. We explore the effects of
different volatile (reactive) sulfur abundances, C/O ratios, initial sulfur
molecular forms, and cosmic-ray ionization rates. We find that a high C/O ratio
can explain both the prevalence of CS observed in disks and the lack of SO
detections, consistent with previous results. Additionally, initial sulfur form
greatly affects the ice abundances in the lower layers of the disk, which has
implications for comet formation and future observations with JWST.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文重新评估了超级蓬松行星的大气逃逸机制，提出了热能量介导的光蒸发(TEMP)新机制，发现这些行星比之前认为的更耐质量损失，其大半径由厚对流包层和辐射大气共同维持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超级蓬松行星的低质量、大半径特性挑战了行星形成和演化模型，其高H/He质量分数会导致快速大气逃逸，引发对其长期保留的疑问。

Method: 开发了耦合演化模型，整合更新的热演化框架与一维流体动力学光蒸发模型，对观测到的超级蓬松行星和年轻低密度行星进行分析。

Result: 发现超级蓬松行星的质量、半径和透射压力与预测相符，表明它们经历了沸腾和光蒸发质量损失的组合过程，其中沸腾占主导。

Conclusion: 低密度行星通常具有厚对流包层和显著辐射大气，这需要5-10地球质量的中等质量和小于30倍地球辐照度的恒星照射，更倾向于FG型恒星而非M矮星。

Abstract: Super-puffs are a class of low-mass, large-radius planets that have
challenged planet formation and evolution models. Their high inferred H/He mass
fractions, required to explain their physical sizes, would lead to rapid
atmospheric escape, raising questions about their long-term retention. Recent
modeling work indicates that low-mass planets typically require 50\% less H/He
mass to match their observed radius, due to significant roles of the radiative
atmosphere and interior heating from the rock/iron core. Here, through a new
quantitative analysis of XUV-driven escape in sub-Neptunes, we find that
previous studies overestimated mass loss, as scaling laws in low-gravity
regimes deviate greatly from the widely used energy-limited regime. We define a
new regime, thermal-energy-mediated photoevaporation (TEMP), in which thermal
energy conversion critically sets the mass-loss rate. These effects make
super-puffs more resilient to mass loss than previously thought. We develop a
coupled evolution model integrating this updated thermal evolution framework
with a 1D hydrodynamic photoevaporation model. Applying this novel, joint model
to observed super-puffs and young low-density planets, we find that their
masses, radii and transit pressures align with predictions assuming either a
clear or hazy atmosphere. This indicates that super-puffs have undergone a
combination of boil-off and photoevaporative mass loss, with boil-off
dominating the process. Our results indicate that low-density planets typically
possess both a thick convective envelope and substantial radiative atmosphere,
which contribute to their large radii. For this to occur, these planets must
have intermediate masses of 5-10$M_\oplus$ and receive stellar insolation
$\lesssim 30F_\oplus$, favoring FG-type stars over M-dwarfs.

TL;DR: 使用JWST对年轻行星质量天体SIMP J0136进行时变光谱分析，发现其大气中存在复杂的云层调制、分子丰度变化和极光加热现象，揭示了深对流层与上层大气之间的相互作用。

Motivation: 年轻行星质量天体和褐矮星在L/T光谱过渡期表现出增强的光变特性，但导致这种变化的机制尚不明确，需要深入研究其大气动力学和化学过程。

Conclusion: SIMP J0136的大气变化由行星尺度波相关的云层调制、非平衡碳化学和电子沉降引起的高空极光加热共同驱动，展示了深对流天气层与上层大气之间的复杂相互作用。

Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral
transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown
dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex
carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this
variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected
with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to
SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd
harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (> 1 bar) corresponding to iron and
forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the
cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along
with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by
atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction
between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and
radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the
near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or
Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N =
14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular
signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying
carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane
absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric
chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct
harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands,
providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the
lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition
from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral
heating via electron precipitation.
