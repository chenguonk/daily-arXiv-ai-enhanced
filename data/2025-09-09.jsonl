Here, we use\nwell-constrained measurements of snow that has metamorphosed into\ncoarse-grained firn and bubbly glacier ice in East Antarctica to test three\ncommonly-used radiative transfer models: delta-Eddington, Hapke, and Shkuratov.\nUsing the measured optical properties, we find that the delta-Eddington model\ngenerally shows the least deviation from the measured albedo, followed by the\nShkuratov and Hapke models, respectively. But when the models are used to infer\nthe grain radius using the measured albedo, the Shkuratov model provides closer\nbest-fit grain radii (off by average factor 0.9) than delta-Eddington (0.6),\nand Hapke (1.8). Despite this, the spectral albedos estimated by the Shkuratov\nand Hapke models using their respective best-fit grain radii deviate more from\nthe measurements than delta-Eddington. This result is caused by the Hapke and\nShkuratov models not accounting for: (1) the increased absorption within dense\nice, and (2) specular reflection at the surface of firn and ice. Additionally,\nall three models do not account for the nonsphericity of bubbles within ice.\nThe combination of these factors leads to model errors generally increasing\nwith increasing grain radius.

Recent work has\nfound that this process may leave an imprint in the H$_2$O spectrum in the form\nof excess flux in the cold H$_2$O lines. In this work, we aim to test the\naccuracy of several common retrieval techniques on full 2D thermochemical disk\nmodels. Moreover, we investigate the cold H$_2$O emission that has been\nproposed as a signature of drift, to gain further insights into the underlying\nradial and vertical distribution of H$_2$O. We present two sets of Dust And\nLInes (DALI) thermochemical models and run several retrieval techniques to\ninvestigate how the retrieved temperature and column density compare to our\nmodels. Single-temperature slab retrievals mainly trace the warm ($\\sim$500 K)\nH$_2$O reservoir, whereas a three-component fit is able to better trace the\nfull temperature gradient in the IR emitting region. Retrieved temperatures\ntend to underestimate the true temperature of the emitting layer due to non-LTE\neffects. The retrieved column density traces close to the mid-IR dust $\\tau=1$\nsurface. We find that the strength of the cold H$_2$O emission is directly\nlinked to the H$_2$O abundance above the snow surface at large radii (>1 au).\nThis implies that sources with excess cold H$_2$O flux likely have a high\nH$_2$O abundance in this region ($\\gtrsim10^{-5}$), higher than predicted by\nthe chemical network. This discrepancy is most likely caused by the absence of\ndust transport processes in our models, further strengthening the theory that\nthis emission may be a signature of radial drift and vertical mixing."}

The\nmodel treats each gas as a separate fluid governed by its own set of Euler\nequations, coupled through collisional momentum and energy exchange terms\nderived from a kinetic relaxation model based on the Boltzmann equation. The\nnumerical scheme employs a first-order operator splitting approach combined\nwith a two-step Euler integrator.

Previously, the open source cloud\nmodeling code Virga (Batalha et al. 2025), the Python version of EddySed\n(Ackerman & Marley, 2001), assumed spherical particles to compute particle mass\nand size distributions throughout the atmosphere. The initial release of Virga\nalso assumed spherical particles to compute Mie scattering properties, which\ninclude the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and optical depth as\na function of particle radius and composition. However, extensive evidence from\nSolar system aerosols, astrophysical disks and dust, and Earth climate studies\nsuggests that non-spherical aggregate particles are common compared to\nidealized compact spherical particles. Following recent advances in\nmicrophysical and opacity modeling, we implement a simple parametrization for\ndynamical and optical (modified mean field theory) effects of fractal aggregate\nparticles into Virga. We then use this new functionality to perform a case\nstudy using basic planetary parameters similar to the well-characterized,\naerosol-laden mini-Neptune GJ 1214 b, using KCl clouds made of aggregate\nparticles. We choose KCl to most directly explore comparisons to previous\nstudies. We demonstrate 1) how our method compares to previous fractal\naggregate particle treatments and 2) how our new fractal treatment affects\ntheoretical spectra of cloudy atmospheres. Overall, our model is faster and\nmore flexible for a wider range of parameter space than previous studies.

We do not confirm the previous helium narrow-band detection in\nHAT-P-26b using high-resolution observations. To identify trends within the\npopulation of warm, hot, and ultra-hot Jupiters, we combined our results with\navailable helium studies from the literature. As predicted by theory, we find\nthat warm Jupiters with helium detections orbit K-type stars. However, the\nhelium detections in hot Jupiters are found in low-density planets orbiting\nF-type stars. There are no helium detections in ultra-hot Jupiters. We compiled\na list of 46 irradiated gas giants, but more helium studies are needed to\nincrease the sample and improve our understanding of atmospheric mass loss\nthrough helium observations."}
