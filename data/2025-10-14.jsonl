Our main avenue to probe atmospheric escape is through the\nnear-infrared metastable helium triplet, which has enabled mass loss rate\nmeasurements for tens of exoplanets. Among them, only a few studies show\nevidence for out-of-transit absorption, supporting the presence of a\nhydrodynamic outflow. However, none of these observations precisely identified\nthe physical extent of the outflow, either due to non-continuous or\nshort-duration observations. This limits our measurements of accurate mass loss\nrates. Here we present the first continuous, full-orbit helium phase curve\nmonitoring of an exoplanet, the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, obtained with\nJWST/NIRISS. It reveals helium absorption for nearly 60% of the orbit at\n>3sigma significance. Our results show that WASP-121b sustains a strong\noutflow, separating into two tails trailing and leading the planet. The\npersistent absorption from these tails, together with their measured radial\nvelocity shifts, suggests that they remain in a collisional fluid regime at\nlarge distances from the planet and display very different dynamics. The\nleading trail has a higher density and moves toward the star, whereas the\ntrailing trail is being pushed away from the star, with the latter being\nblue-shifted due to stellar irradiation pressure. While qualitatively agreeing\nwith theoretical expectations, the observed structure of helium is not\nself-consistently reproducible by current models, limiting constraints on the\nmass loss rate. Furthermore, we show that while ground-based observations of\nthe helium triplet are essential to measure the outflow dynamics precisely,\nthey ideally should be combined with continuous JWST phase curves to constrain\nthe absolute level of helium absorption."}

Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone\nof its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not\nknow in advance which point source detection corresponds to which planet. This\n\"confusion\" problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high\noccurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of\nprior knowledge about planets' orbital parameters or characteristics,\nparticularly for systems at high inclination with respect to the observer. This\nwork addresses the confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new\norbit ranking function to augment the \"deconfuser\" tool and account for phase\nvariation exhibited by a planet throughout its orbit. We demonstrate the new\nranking scheme on a subset of thirty highly confused simulated multi-planet\nsystems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). Results\nindicate that photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits\nin 7/10 of the low inclination cases, 6/10 of the medium inclination cases, and\n6/10 of the high inclination cases.

We examine key parameters, including the initial satellite-planet\ndistance, disk lifetime (proxy for the planet's final orbital distance),\nsatellite mass, and satellite tidal dissipation. For simulations incorporating\ndynamical tides, we explore three different initial stellar rotation periods.\nWe find that satellite survival is rare if the satellite has nonzero tidal\ndissipation. Survival is only possible for initial orbital distances of at\nleast 0.6 times the Jupiter-Io separation and for planets orbiting beyond about\n0.1 AU. Satellites that fail to survive are either 1) tidally disrupted, as\nthey experience orbital decay and cross the Roche limit, or 2) dynamically\ndisrupted, where eccentricity excitation drives their periastron within the\nRoche limit. Satellite survival is more likely for low tidal dissipation and\nhigher satellite mass.

It is now known to host at least five\nplanets with orbital periods ranging from 17 hours to 15 years. It is also one\nof the most extreme metal rich stars in the neighbourhood and it has a low-mass\nsecondary star. In this article, we present data obtained at the\nCanada-France-Hawai'i Telescope with the SPIRou spectropolarimeter on both\ncomponents of the 55 Cnc stellar system. We revisit the long-period\nradial-velocity signals of 55 Cnc A, with a focus on the role of the magnetic\ncycle, and propose the existence of a sixth planet candidate, whose period\nfalls close to that of the magnetic cycle, or half of it. The other massive\nouter planet has a revised period of 13.15 years and a minimum mass of 3.8\nMJup. Although some uncertainty remains on these outer planets, the\ncharacterization of the four inner planets is very robust through the\ncombination of many different data sets, and all signals are consistent in the\nnIR and optical domains. In addition, the magnetic topology of the solar-type\nprimary component of the system is observed by SPIRou at the minimum of its\nactivity cycle, characterized by an amplitude ten times smaller than observed\nduring its maximum in 2017. For the low-mass component 55 Cnc B, we report the\ndiscovery of two exoplanets in the system, with a period of 6.799+-0.0014 and\n33.75+-0.04 days and a minimum mass of 3.5+-0.8 and 5.3+-1.4 MEarth,\nrespectively. The secondary magnetic field is very weak and the current data\nset does not allow its precise characterization, setting an upper limit of 10\nG. The system 55 Cnc stands out as the sixth binary system with planetary\nsystems around both components, and the first one with non equal-mass stellar\ncomponents."}

Therefore, surveys dedicated to finding these rare\nplanets have a key role to play by growing the sample to overcome small number\nstatistics. In this work we present MANGOS, a programme dedicated to the search\nfor giant objects (planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars) orbiting M\ndwarfs. We report on the discovery of five new giant planets (TOI-3288 Ab,\nTOI-4666 b, TOI-5007 b, TOI-5292 Ab, TOI-5916 b) first detected by TESS, and\nconfirmed using ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. The five planets have\nradii in the range 0.99-1.12 $\\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$, masses between\n0.49--1.69~$\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, and orbital periods between 1.43 and 2.91 days.\nWe reveal that TOI-3288 and TOI-5292 are wide binaries, and in the case of\nTOI-5292 we are able to characterise both stellar components. We demonstrate\nthat the planets presented are suitable for further characterisation of their\nobliquities and atmospheres. We detect a small but significant eccentricity for\nTOI-5007 b, although for this to be more robust, more observations are needed\nto fully sample the orbit. Finally, we reveal a correlation between stellar\nmetallicity and planet bulk density for giant planets orbiting low-mass stars."}

Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M\ndwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering\nvaluable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to\ncharacterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS.\nHigh-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR,\ncombining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and\nimplement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric\ncontamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and\nground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the\nsystems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A\n(K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of\n$2.11\\pm0.08~M_{\\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \\pm 0.03~R_{\\rm Jup}$, with an\norbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\\rm eq} = 1059 \\pm 20~{\\rm K}$). TOI-4666\nhosts a $0.70_{-0.06}^{+0.05}~M_{\\rm Jup}$ warm Jupiter ($T_{\\rm eq} = 713 \\pm\n14~{\\rm K}$) with a radius of $1.11 \\pm 0.04~R_{\\rm Jup}$, and an orbital\nperiod of 2.91 days. We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral\ntype, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs.\nMore massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted\nby more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction\namong low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing\ngiant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends\nagree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate\nfor lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation\nand migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities."}
