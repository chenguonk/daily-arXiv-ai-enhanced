Code available at\n  https://github.com/dyahalomi/lunar_impacts", "summary": "NASA's Artemis Mission aims to return astronauts to the Moon and establish a\nbase at the lunar south pole. A key challenge is understanding the threat from\nmicrometeoroid impacts, which are too small to monitor directly. Using NASA's\nMeteoroid Engineering Model 3 (\\texttt{MEM~3}), we estimate micrometeoroid\nimpact rates on a base comparable in size to the International Space Station\n(100\\,m $\\times$ 100\\,m $\\times$ 10\\,m). We find that a lunar base would\nexperience $\\sim$15,000--23,000 incident impacts per year by micrometeoroids\nwith a mass range of $10^{-6}$--$10^{1}$~g, depending on location -- with\nminima at the lunar poles, a maximum near the sub-Earth longitude, and a factor\nof $\\sim$1.6 variation between the two. To assess the mitigating effect of\nprotection systems, we present a functional relationship describing the number\nof impacts that penetrate the shielding as a function of the minimum meteoroid\nmass capable of penetrating the shield -- the ``critical mass.'' We estimate\nthat state-of-the-art Whipple shields protect against $\\sim$99.9997\\% of\nmicrometeoroids. By re-running \\texttt{MEM~3} with a minimum mass equal to the\ncritical mass of modern Whipple shields, we determine that a shielded lunar\nbase would experience $\\sim$0.024--0.037 penetrating impacts per year -- again\nwith minima at the poles and a maximum near the sub-Earth longitude. These\nresults indicate that (1) the lunar poles are optimal for sustained habitation,\n(2) gravitational focusing by Earth dominates over its geometric shielding for\nthis micrometeoroid flux, and (3) current shielding technology can reduce\nmicrometeoroid threats by nearly five orders of magnitude, making long-duration\nlunar habitation feasible."}

The orbital period ratio of the two\noutermost planets, namely TOI-282 c and d, is close to the 3:2\ncommensurability, suggesting that the planets might be trapped in a mean motion\nresonance. We combined space-borne photometry from the TESS telescope with\nhigh-precision HARPS and ESPRESSO Doppler measurements to refine orbital\nparameters, measure the planetary masses, and investigate the architecture and\nevolution of the system. We performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo joint analysis\nof the transit light curves and radial velocity time series, and carried out a\ndynamical analysis to model transit timing variations and Doppler measurements\nalong with N-body integration. In agreement with previous results, we found\nthat TOI-282 b, c, and d have radii of $R_b=2.69 \\pm 0.23 \\ R_{\\oplus}$,\n$R_c=4.13^{+0.16}_{-0.14} \\ R_{\\oplus}$, and $R_d=3.11 \\pm 0.15 \\ R_{\\oplus}$,\nrespectively.

Such features\noffer valuable insights into the chemical composition, thermal structure, and\ncloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. High-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations can be used to study the line-forming regions in exoplanet\natmospheres and potentially detect signals despite the presence of clouds. We\naimed to detect various molecular species and constrain the chemical abundances\nand cloud deck pressures using high-resolution spectroscopy. We observed\nmultiple transits of these planets with CARMENES and applied the\ncross-correlation method to detect atmospheric signatures. Further, we used an\ninjection-recovery approach and retrievals to place constraints on the\natmospheric properties. We detected a tentative H$_2$O signal for KELT-11b but\nnot for WASP-69b, and searches for other molecules such as H$_2$S and CH$_4$\nresulted in non-detections for both planets. By investigating the signal\nstrength of injected synthetic models, we constrained which atmospheric\nabundances and cloud deck pressures are consistent with our cross-correlation\nresults. In addition, we show that a retrieval-based approach leads to similar\nconstraints of these parameters."}

Sampling performance, model\nselection, and the search for Earth-mass planets are evaluated in data for 51\nPegasi, HD 55693 and Barnard's Star (GJ 699). For 51 Pegasi, APT achieves an\neffective sampling increase over DNS by a factor 3.76, while retrieving tighter\nparameter estimates. For HD 55693 the stellar rotation\n$P_{\\text{rot}}=29.72^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and magnetic cycle\n$P_{\\text{mag}}=2557.0^{+70.1}_{-36.7}$ are recovered, while demonstrating the\nsensitivity of $\\ln{\\mathcal{Z}}$ to prior selection. For Barnard's star,\nseveral noise models are compared, and the confirmed planet parameters are\nsuccessfully retrieved with all of them.
