TL;DR: 通过51颗高污染白矛星的氧元素分析，研究发现外星身体水分含量从干燥到水丰富不等，平均水分负荷约为25%，体现了外星上水资源的普遍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用污染白矛星作为直探外星身体组成的独特工具，通过氧元素分析来探索外星身体的水分含量和分布特征。

Method: 分析51颗高污染白矛星的氧元素丰度，包括三颗H主导大气白矛星的新数据，考虑吸积碳盘的观测阶段和寿命对父体元素丰度推断的影响。

Result: 发现白矛星吸积的身体水分含量范围广泛，平均不确定性约15%，平均水分负荷约25%。在He主导白矛星中，35/39的水分量与H丰度一致，31/51的白矛星可能吸积了非零水分的身体。

Conclusion: 研究证实了外星上水资源的普遍存在，但H主导白矛星的水分含量仍低于He主导的，需要更大样本和更好的温度范围来解释这种差异。这一发现与之前的相关研究结论存在差异。

Abstract: Polluted white dwarfs offer a unique way to directly probe the compositions
of exoplanetary bodies. We examine the water content of accreted material using
the oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample,
we present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that
showed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the
impact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred
elemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our
results indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich
material, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\approx$15\%.
Amongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent
with corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be
ambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body,
when considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is
statistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass
fraction of $\approx$25\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions,
we find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This
conclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf
pollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case. Pollution in
H-dominated white dwarfs continues to be more water-poor than in their
He-dominated cousins, although the sample size of H-dominated white dwarfs
remains small and the two samples still suffer a disjunction in the range of
host star temperatures being probed.

### [2] [Aerosol dynamics on hot exoplanets: the role of radiation pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20175)
*James E. Owen,Ruth A. Murray-Clay*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 辐射压力对系外行星气溶胶动力学有重要影响，能加速高空雾霾颗粒，使其尺寸变小、浓度降低，从而改变透射光谱特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气溶胶在系外行星大气中普遍存在，但对其物理过程理解不完整，影响了大气性质的准确测量。需要研究辐射压力这一被忽视的物理过程对气溶胶动力学的影响。

Method: 使用二维赤道带模型模拟雾霾状气溶胶，分析辐射压力对颗粒加速度的影响，研究其对终端速度和生长速率的作用。

Result: 辐射压力可达到重力的10-20倍，加速高空雾霾颗粒使其生长变慢、尺寸变小、浓度降低，导致透射光谱光学斜率变陡，近红外分子特征减弱程度降低。

Conclusion: 辐射压力是系外行星气溶胶动力学中的重要物理过程，会影响透射光谱特征和分子特征振幅，需要在气溶胶建模中予以考虑。

Abstract: Aerosols appear to be ubiquitous in exoplanetary atmospheres. However because
our understanding of the physical processes that govern aerosols is incomplete,
their presence makes the measurement of atmospheric properties, such as
molecular abundance ratios, difficult. We show that aerosol particles in
highly-irradiated exoplanets experience an additional acceleration due to
stellar radiation pressure. The strength of this radiative acceleration often
exceeds the planet's gravity and can approach values of ~10-20x gravity's for
low-density planets (typically sub-Saturns) hosting ~0.1--1 micron aerosols.
Since these highly irradiated, low-density planets are often the best targets
for atmospheric characterisation with current instrumentation, radiation
pressure is likely an important process when considering aerosol dynamics. We
find that radiation pressure accelerates hazes produced by photochemistry at
high altitudes to faster terminal velocities, causing them to grow more slowly.
Hence, the particles are smaller and have lower mass concentrations in the
presence of radiation pressure. By simulating haze-like aerosols in a 2D
equatorial band model, we show that radiation pressure steepens optical slopes
in transmission spectra, resulting in less muted molecular features in the
Near-IR and gives rise to a correlation between the strength of radiation
pressure and the molecular feature amplitude. Furthermore, the interaction of
zonal winds and radiation pressure impacts both the optical slopes and
amplitudes on the individual morning and evening terminators.

### [3] [Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20183)
*Hang Yu,Shu Yan Lau,Ethan Mckeever,Phil Arras,Nevin N. Weinberg*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个考虑非线性流体动力学效应的广义罗希极限理论框架，发现在高偏心轨道中流体不稳定性更容易在近心点发展，质量流失阈值可比传统圆形轨道预测值高30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补罗希极限分析中流体动力学效应修正的研究空白，传统分析主要基于流体静力平衡和同步旋转的圆形轨道假设

Method: 建立包含非线性流体动力学的理论框架，使用仿射模型描述不可压缩椭球体，推导精确非线性方程和级数展开方程，考虑通用轨道和同步水平

Result: 轨道偏心率增加时，流体不稳定性更易在近心点发展；高偏心轨道（e≈0.9）且流体阻尼较小时，质量流失阈值可比圆形轨道预测值高30%；单次通过时阈值比静态极限小20%；非线性相互作用可触发混沌流体演化

Conclusion: 该研究对偏心轨道中的相互作用双星系统具有广泛意义，包括迁移中的气态系外行星、重复部分潮汐瓦解事件等

Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object
(the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's
tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and
has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist
considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We
fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving
nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived
from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded
ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation
addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M,
and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show
that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to
develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates
over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with
eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold
pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30%
higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic
equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold
separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at
each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M
even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic
tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for
interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous
exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.

TL;DR: 对103P/Hartley 2彗星2023年回归期的光度观测显示其亮度持续衰减，表明挥发性物质逐渐耗尽，活跃度显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哈特利2号彗星的长期亮度变化趋势，了解木星族彗星的演化过程

Method: 利用全球公民天文学家网络进行光度观测，使用自动化管道处理eVscope数据，通过孔径测光技术分析

Result: 彗星峰值亮度为10.24±0.47等，自1991年以来每回归周期亮度下降0.59±0.11等，相当于每次回归亮度减少约42%

Conclusion: 哈特利2号彗星活跃度已下降约一个数量级，可能不再符合超活跃彗星的定义，这种衰减主要由挥发性物质耗尽而非轨道效应引起

Abstract: We report photometric observations of Comet 103P/Hartley 2 during its 2023
apparition. Our campaign, conducted from August through December 2023, combined
data from a global network of citizen astronomers coordinated by Unistellar and
the Association Fran\c{c}aise d'Astronomie. Photometry was derived using an
automated pipeline for eVscope observations in partnership with the SETI
Institute and aperture photometry via AstroLab Stellar. We find that the
comet's peak reduced brightness, measured at $G_{\rm min} = 10.24 \pm 0.47$,
continues a long-term fading trend since 1991. The decline in activity follows
a per-apparition minimum magnitude increase of $\Delta G_{\rm min} = 0.59 \pm
0.11$ mag, corresponding to an approximately $42\%$ reduction in brightness
each return. This trend implies that the comet's active fraction has declined
by about an order of magnitude since 1991 and may indicate that Hartley 2 is no
longer hyperactive by definition. The fading is consistent with progressive
volatile depletion rather than orbital effects. These results offer insight
into the evolutionary processes shaping Jupiter-family comets.

### [5] [The impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity on giant planet formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20291)
*Heather F. Johnston,Olja Panić,Beibei Liu,Patryk Jankowski*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了前主序星光度演化对巨行星形成的影响，发现恒星光度变化会显著影响原行星盘的加热和行星形成效率，特别是对1-2.4太阳质量恒星周围的巨行星形成具有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前主序星的光度在行星盘寿命期间会演化，这对行星形成的环境有重要影响，但现有行星形成模型很少考虑这一因素。研究旨在量化光度演化对巨行星形成的影响。

Method: 采用卵石驱动的核心吸积行星形成模型，针对1-2.4太阳质量范围内的宿主恒星，模拟前主序星光度演化对巨行星形成过程的影响。

Result: 发现巨行星形成对恒星光度演化很敏感，高光度会增加气体和卵石的尺度高度，降低卵石吸积效率，使巨行星形成更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 恒星光度演化显著影响巨行星的形成位置和时间，对行星组成有重要影响，强调需要在行星形成模型中纳入这一因素。

Abstract: Luminosities of pre-main sequence stars evolve during the protoplanetary disc
lifetime. This has a significant impact on the heating of their surrounding
protoplanetary disks, the natal environments of planets. Moreover, stars of
different masses evolve differently. However, this is rarely accounted for in
planet formation models. We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet
formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar
luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range
of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive
to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at
which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity
causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may
decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form
giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these
giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet
formation models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过高分辨率光谱观测和3D水动力学模拟研究WASP-52 b行星的大气逃逸现象，发现该行星处于流线形态和尾巴形态之间的过渡游离温度区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究WASP-52 b行星大气逃逸的程度和形态，识别其是否存在类似HAT-P-67 b和HAT-P-32 b的流线形结构，并了解其在热海王星漏洞中的特殊地位

Method: 使用CRIRES+和CARMENES高分辨率光谱仪观测更广泛的轨道相位范围，分析He I 10833 À线作为逃逸标记物，并结合3D水动力学模拟和改进的辐射传输方法评估可能的流出形态

Result: 在观测到的轨道相位中未发现行星物质的显著证据，但3D模型显示这种结构可能存在于观测检测极限之下；氨线缺乏可检测的蓝移排除了强烈的白天到夜间各异性场景

Conclusion: WASP-52 b的大气流出可以定义为中等水动力学逃逸参数，处于形成流线形态的冷流出和形成尾巴的热流出之间的过渡游离温度区域

Abstract: WASP-52 b is an inflated hot Jupiter with a large Roche lobe filling
fraction, positioned in the hot Neptune desert. Previous in-transit
observations of the helium triplet at 10833 A have reported a range of excess
absorption values (1.5%-5.5%) and a lack of net blueshift relative to the
planet's rest frame, distinguishing it from other escaping atmospheres. This
study investigates the extent and morphology of material escaping from WASP-52
b, assessing whether its outflow resembles a stream-like structure, as
suggested for HAT-P-67 b and HAT-P-32 b. We obtained high-resolution spectra
with CRIRES+ and CARMENES, covering a broader orbital phase range ($\varphi
\approx \pm0.1, \pm0.2, 0.5$) than previous studies. By analyzing the He I
10833 A line as a tracer of escape, we search for extended absorption beyond
transit. Additionally, we explore possible outflow morphologies with
three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with an improved
radiative transfer approach, assessing the He I 10833 A triplet. The helium
line shows no significant evidence of planetary material at the orbital phases
observed in this work, though 3D modeling suggests such a structure could exist
below observational detection limits. We conclude that the atmospheric outflow
of WASP-52 b can be characterized by an intermediate hydrodynamic escape
parameter, placing it in a transitional regime between cold outflows forming a
stream-like morphology and hot outflows forming a tail. Additionally, the
absence of a detectable in-transit blueshift in the helium line rules out a
strong day-to-nightside anisotropy scenario.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 更新了CODE彗星轨道目录，为369颗长周期彗星提供了983个轨道解，包含完整的误差估计和动力学分类，重点关注近抛物线彗星的动力学状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于观测偏差和轨道解的不确定性，对外太阳系长周期彗星的空间分布和动力学历史理解有限，需要提供全面且动力学均匀的轨道数据库。

Method: 通过计算原始和未来质心轨道、前后近日点轨道参数，使用蒙特卡洛方法估计不确定性，并考虑行星、银河系和过境恒星的扰动。

Result: CODE数据库现在包含983个轨道解，覆盖了几乎所有原始半长轴超过10,000天文单位的彗星，以及所有在10天文单位外发现的长周期彗星。

Conclusion: 该更新为研究长周期彗星的起源、演化和动力学状态提供了重要的基础数据，特别是为动态新彗星制定了新的约束条件。

Abstract: Context. The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of
long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution
and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and
uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. Aims. We aim to
provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to
support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D
distribution of orbital elements. Methods. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary
Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and
future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion,
using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainties estimation
and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations
according to the latest data and algorithms. Results. This update of the CODE
catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using
current stellar data, we formulate new constraints for dynamically new comets.
Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full
uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets
with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000 au and discovered before 2022,
as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10 au from the Sun during during this
period, and over 80% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7 au.

TL;DR: 金属氯化物和氯化物分子在金星表面氛围中以追踪浓度存在，沉积形成硫酸盐颗粒，与先锋号金星探测器观测到的三层粘粒层高度相符。小于0.3微米的颗粒可通过扩散从地面升至硫酸云底部，而大于1微米的颗粒仅能在10公里以下存在。颗粒带负电荷阻止凝聚，保持了渗透率测量数据的一致性。

Motivation: 研究金星下层大气(<50km)中(次)\u5fae米氛粒的数量、尺寸分布和物质组成，以理解金星氛粒的形成机制和运动特性。

Method: 使用GGchem相平衡模型预测气体中金属氯化物和氯化物分子的浓度，采用改进版的DiffuDrift模型(Woitke等2020年开发)分析沉积过程和颗粒运动。

Result: 金属氯化物沉积形成K2SO4、Na2SO4和FeS2硫酸盐颗粒，高度分别为15.5km、9.5km和2.4km，与实际观测的三层粘粒层一致。小颗粒(<0.3微米)可从地面扩散升至云层，而大颗粒(>1微米)仅限于地面附近。颗粒带有负电荷(地面每微米半径100个，45km高度每微米半径50个)阻止凝聚。

Conclusion: 金星表面氛围中的金属氯化物沉积形成硫酸盐颗粒，解释了观测到的多层粘粒结构。颗粒电荷在维持颗粒分布和阻止凝聚中起关键作用，小颗粒可以通过扩散进入高层大气。

Abstract: We study the amount, size distribution and material composition of (sub-)mic
aerosol particles in the lower Venus atmosphere < 50 km. Our GGchem
phase-equilibrium model predicts metal-chloride and metal-fluoride molecules to
be present in the gas over the Venus surface in trace concentrations < 2.E-12,
in particular FeCl2, NaCl, KCl and SiF4. Using an improved version of the
DiffuDrift model developed by Woitke et al.2020, we find that these molecules
deposit to form solid potassium sulphate K2SO4, sodium sulphate Na2SO4, and
pyrite FeS2 above about 15.5 km, 9.5 km and 2.4 km, respectively. These heights
coincide well with the three potential haze layers found in the Pioneer Venus
Large Probe neutral mass spectrometer data by Mogul et al.2023. The particles
with radius < 0.3 mic can be dredged up from the ground to reach the sulphuric
acid cloud base from below by diffusion. The particle density decreases from ~
5000/cm3 at ground level to ~100/cm3 at a height of 45 km. Particles larger
than about 1 mic are found to stay confined to the ground < 10 km, indicating
that the larger, so-called mode 3 particles, if they exist, cannot originate
from the surface. All particles are expected to be coated by a thin layer of
FeS2, Na2SO4 and K2SO4. We have included the repelling effect of particle
charges on the coagulation, without which the model would predict much too
steep gradients close to the surface, which is inconsistent with measured
opacity data. Our models suggest that the particles must have at least 100
negative charges per micron of particle radius at ground level, and > 50/mic at
a height of 45 km.

TL;DR: 垂直剪切不稳定性(VSI)在原生行星盘中产生湍流和角动量传输，高分辨率3D模拟显示其饱和特性收敛，产生α=1.3e-3的角动量传输，但无持久性结构特征。

Motivation: 研究VSI在径向延伸盘中的饱和特性及其收敛性，了解该不稳定性如何产生湍流和传输角动量。

Method: 使用GPU加速代码Idefix进行完全3D全局盘模型模拟，分辨率高达每标尺高度200个点，盘纵横比H/R=0.1，覆盖完整2π方位角范围。

Result: 大尺度传输特性在每标尺高度100个点时收敛，产生Shakura-Sunyaev α=1.3e-3；内边界条件伪影影响计算域；无持久性带状流、压力凸起或涡旋；湍流级联符合临界平衡旋转湍流框架。

Conclusion: VSI在原生行星盘中产生剧烈湍流和向外角动量传输，但无显著持久性特征来促进行星形成；内边界条件伪影影响VSI波列，建议系统使用径向延伸计算域。

Abstract: (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising
mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in
protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex
physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended
discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely
unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence
using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so
as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent
cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to
200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi
azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.
  Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged
with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3.
Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational
domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation
wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence.
Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices,
in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the
turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the
framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.
  Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs,
associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant
long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions
of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts
affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used
in a more systematic manner.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 重新评估M矮星系统中磁星-行星相互作用的射电发射模型，支持Proxima b、YZ Cet b和GJ 1151 b处于亚阿尔文状态，但预测发射水平较低，自由-自由吸收可能影响探测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过射电观测明确检测磁星-行星相互作用（SPI）可以为探测系外行星及其磁场提供新方法，但亚木星质量行星的直接射电探测受到低频限制。

Method: 使用公开Python代码SIRIO对Proxima Centauri、YZ Ceti和GJ 1151系统进行建模，比较亚阿尔文SPI的射电发射预测，并与文献结果进行基准测试。

Result: 支持这些系统中的行星处于亚阿尔文状态，阿尔文翼模型预测射电发射水平很低，但磁重联发生时探测前景更好，自由-自由吸收在YZ Ceti中可能起重要作用。

Conclusion: SIRIO代码可用于评估SPI射电探测提案的可行性，并约束恒星风质量损失率或行星磁场强度。

Abstract: The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio
observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing
their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is
hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\'enic SPI predict
that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce
detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio
emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems
Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio
detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and
Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission
from sub-Alfv\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic
systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature.
Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the
putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime
(assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We
find that the Alfv\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio
emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection
are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a
relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to
evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to
constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.
