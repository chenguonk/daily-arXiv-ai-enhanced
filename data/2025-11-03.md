### [1] [Saving Doomed Planets: Mass Loss and Angular Momentum Return Boost Hot Jupiter Survival Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26882)
*Grant C. Weldon,Bradley M. S. Hansen,Smadar Naoz*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文通过改进潮汐质量损失和角动量返还的处理方法，重新研究了Eccentric Kozai-Lidov机制驱动热木星形成的理论模型，发现改进后的模型能更好地解释观测到的热木星发生率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论模型难以重现观测到的热木星发生率，因为传统模型预测许多源'冷木星'在高度偏心轨道上会被潮汐瓦解破坏。

Method: 结合长期动力学演化与行星结构演化（使用MESA模块），采用改进的潮汐质量损失和角动量返还处理方法，进行数值模拟和解析分析。

Result: 改进的潮汐质量损失处理使热木星存活率提高2-3倍，发生率（FGK恒星周围≥0.5%）与观测一致；角动量返还可能在三天轨道周期附近产生热木星堆积，与观测统计相符。

Conclusion: EKL驱动的高偏心迁移结合现实的潮汐质量损失可能是热木星形成的主要通道。

Abstract: The existence of giant extrasolar planets on short-period orbits ("hot
Jupiters") represents a challenge to theories of planet formation. A leading
explanation invokes perturbations from distant companions, i.e., the Eccentric
Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, which can excite the eccentricities of initially
wide-orbiting planets to values of order unity. The resulting tidal dissipation
at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbits to their observed
configurations. While observations of orbital misalignment and distant
companions support this scenario, theoretical models have struggled to
reproduce the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate. Population synthesis
studies often predict that many source "cold Jupiters" are destroyed by tidal
disruption during highly eccentric passages. We revisit this question with
improved treatments of the mass loss and angular momentum return experienced by
tidally perturbed planets. Numerical studies are performed by combining secular
dynamical evolution with planetary structural evolution using Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We also use an analytical approach
to estimate rates of tidal disruption and hot Jupiter survival. Our new
population synthesis studies of giant planets in stellar binaries show that
improved treatment of tidal mass loss enhances hot Jupiter survival by a factor
of $\sim2-3$, yielding occurrence rates ($\gtrsim 0.5\%$ around FGK stars)
consistent with observations. Angular momentum return from mass accreted onto
the star may also produce a pileup of hot Jupiters near three-day orbital
periods that is in statistical agreement with observations. These results
suggest that EKL-driven high-eccentricity migration, when combined with
realistic planetary mass loss, may be a dominant channel for hot Jupiter
formation.

### [2] [Accelerating Radiative Transfer for Planetary Atmospheres by Orders of Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27050)
*Isaac Malsky,Tiffany Kataria,Natasha E. Batalha,Matthew Graham*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用编码器-仅Transformer神经网络架构开发辐射传输模拟器，相比传统方法实现100倍加速，测试集平均误差约1%，可用于行星大气模型中的快速准确辐射传输计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统辐射传输计算方法计算量大，在大模型中需要数值简化，导致精度下降。机器学习模拟是理想选择，因为它是从静态大气剖面到通量的明确定义物理映射，且可以从第一性原理计算生成高保真训练数据。

Method: 使用编码器-仅Transformer神经网络架构，在代表太阳成分热木星大气的1D剖面上进行训练，模拟双流层通量。

Result: 模拟器再现了双流层通量，测试集平均误差约1%，相比传统方法实现了100倍加速。

Conclusion: 机器学习模拟辐射传输为行星大气模型（如GCMs）中更快更准确的计算程序开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary
atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose
accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical
simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade
the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal
candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined
physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and
high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations.
We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer
neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of
solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric
two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the
traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer
with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate
routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.

### [3] [Micrometeoroid Impacts: Dual Pathways for Iron Reduction and Oxidation on Lunar and Asteroidal Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27092)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过分子动力学模拟揭示了微陨石撞击在月球表面同时产生还原和氧化环境的机制，解释了纳米相金属铁和赤铁矿在月球上的共存现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球极区发现赤铁矿这一高度氧化的铁形态，与月球还原环境的主流认知相矛盾，需要解释这种氧化铁的形成机制。

Method: 使用ReaxFF分子动力学模拟微陨石撞击铁橄榄石的过程，研究原子尺度上还原和氧化铁物种的形成机制。

Result: 模拟显示撞击坑表面产生高温高压的还原环境形成纳米相金属铁，而在膨胀羽流中形成瞬态富氧环境产生氧化铁。

Conclusion: 微陨石撞击通过同时产生空间分离的氧化还原环境，为月球上纳米相金属铁和赤铁矿的共存提供了形成机制，完善了空间风化过程的理解。

Abstract: Nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) is a key indicator of space
weathering on the lunar surface, primarily attributed to solar wind irradiation
and micrometeoroid impacts. Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2
\mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions
challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This
study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on
fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic
mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations
reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater
surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient
oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously
disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the
puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed
strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of
the Moon. These findings highlight that micrometeoroid impacts, by
simultaneously generating spatially distinct redox environments, provide a
formation mechanism that reconciles the ubiquitous identification of nanophase
metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) in returned lunar samples with
$\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ signatures detected by remote sensing. This underscores the
dynamic nature of space weathering processes. For a more nuanced understanding
of regolith evolution, we should also consider the presence of different
generations or types of $\mathrm{npFe}{ }^0$, such as those formed from solar
wind reduction versus impact disproportionation.

### [4] [A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework NEXOTRANS for Emission Spectroscopy: New Constraints and Atmospheric Characterization of WASP-69b Using JWST NIRCam and MIRI Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27223)
*Tonmoy Deka,Liton Majumdar,Tasneem Basra Khan,Swastik Dewan,Priyankush Ghosh,Debayan Das,Mithun Patra*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发了NEXOTRANS发射光谱反演模块，结合贝叶斯和机器学习技术，应用于WASP-69b的JWST观测数据，成功约束了多种气体成分和大气参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST提供了更宽波长覆盖、更高灵敏度和分辨率的系外行星热发射光谱数据，需要能够处理复杂参数空间的反演框架来准确解释这些数据。

Method: 使用NEXOTRANS发射反演模块，采用一维和二维辐射传输近似，结合贝叶斯和机器学习技术，并整合近似非平衡化学模型来推断光化学物种如SO2。

Result: 对WASP-69b的JWST观测数据反演成功约束了H2O、CO2、CO、CH4和SO2的体积混合比，最佳模型给出H2O log(VMR)=-3.78，CO2 log(VMR)=-5.77，并推断出C/O=0.42和超太阳金属丰度。

Conclusion: NEXOTRANS能够显著推进JWST发射光谱的解释能力，为系外行星大气研究提供更深入的见解。

Abstract: Thermal emission spectra provide key insights into the atmospheric
composition and especially the temperature structure of an exoplanet. With
broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has
enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of
photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable
of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In
this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which
employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and
leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also
incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical
species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission
observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place
robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and
potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with
non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O
and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The
second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium
chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42
(+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding
to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval
also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible
absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight
NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra
interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 对碳质球粒陨石进行ICP-MS和ICP-AES分析，揭示未分化小行星的化学成分，评估其作为空间资源利用的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未分化小行星（特别是富含碳的球粒陨石母体）可能含有有价值的金属和稀土元素，但对其整体元素组成的理解有限，需要更精确的分析数据。

Method: 使用电感耦合等离子体质谱法（ICP-MS）和电感耦合等离子体原子发射光谱法（ICP-AES）对代表性碳质球粒陨石样品进行分析。

Result: 揭示了多个球粒陨石群中过渡金属、亲铁元素和稀土元素的丰度和分布模式。

Conclusion: C型小行星可作为关键材料的可行来源，为未来任务规划、提取策略和低重力资源操作技术开发提供信息。

Abstract: Undifferentiated asteroids, particularly the parent bodies of carbon-rich
chondrite groups, might be promising candidates for future space resource
utilization due to their primitive composition and potential to host valuable
metals and rare earth elements. However, our understanding of their bulk
elemental composition remains limited, as most data are derived from
reflectance spectra with low mineralogical resolution. Sample return missions
have started to change that, as returned materials are already available to
study. Still the available meteorites provide a valuable source of information
about the diversity of undifferentiated asteroids in the interplanetary space.
To improve compositional insights, we conducted Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ICP-AES (Inductively coupled Plasma Atomic Emission
Spectroscopy) analyses on a representative suite of carbonaceous chondrites.
These meteorites, considered analogs of undifferentiated asteroids, preserve
materials from the early solar system and provide a geochemical record of their
parent bodies. Our results highlight the abundance and distribution of
transition metals, siderophile elements, and rare earth elements across several
chondrite groups. These findings support the view that C-type asteroids may
serve as viable sources of critical materials, while also informing future
mission planning, extraction strategies, and the development of new
technologies for low-gravity resource operations.

### [6] [Stacking transmission spectra of different exoplanets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27386)
*James Kirk,James E. Owen*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了系外行星透射光谱的叠加方法，证明了叠加光谱在数学上近似等价于各行星丰度比的几何平均值生成的光谱，并分析了温度、组分和云层对叠加效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着拥有透射光谱的系外行星数量增加，需要理解何时适合叠加不同行星的光谱以及叠加光谱的物理意义，特别是对于观测时间较长的长周期行星。

Method: 通过比较叠加光谱与几何平均光谱，在JWST的NIRSpec/G395H波长范围内测试了不同组分（如H2O、CO2、CH4）和温度条件下的光谱叠加效果。

Result: 对于两种主要组分，当丰度比在行星间自相似时，几何平均能准确反映叠加光谱；引入第三种组分时，温度成为关键因素，在CO/CH4边界处叠加不再适用；表面重力影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究为系外行星群体研究中光谱叠加的适用性和解释提供了指导，特别是在不同组分和温度条件下的应用限制。

Abstract: In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or
stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics.
As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it
becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets
is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be
particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of
the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet
transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra
generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test
this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward
models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\mu$m). For two
dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately
reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across
planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a
critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$
boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within
comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct
sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks
required to rule out a flat spectrum at $>5\sigma$, as a function of both cloud
deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance
on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in
the era of population studies of exoplanets.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了双星系统中强不对齐盘的光照变化效应，发现盘面亮度会随双星轨道周期显著变化，产生周期性光变曲线，可用于约束盘的结构和冷却速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强不对齐双星系统中，中央双星在盘轨道平面上下垂直运动导致的光照变化对盘外观的影响，特别是在HD 98800B极盘系统中的表现。

Method: 使用解析模型和辐射传输模型分析恒星光照变化对盘外观的影响，重点关注HD 98800B极盘系统。

Result: 观测到的盘通量在双星轨道周期内显著变化，产生周期性光变曲线，每个双星轨道周期出现两个峰值，通量变化程度受盘几何形状强烈影响。

Conclusion: 这些通量变化产生多个可观测特征，这些观测特征可能为约束盘的不同属性（如垂直结构、几何形状和冷却速率）提供依据。

Abstract: In binary systems with a strongly misaligned disk, the central binary stars
can travel a significant vertical distance above and below the disk's orbital
plane. This can cause large changes in illumination of the disk over the course
of the binary orbital period. We use both analytic and radiative transfer
models to examine the effect of changes in stellar illumination on the
appearance of the disk, particularly in the case of the polar disk HD 98800B.
We find that the observed flux from the disk can vary significantly over the
binary orbital period, producing a periodically varying lightcurve which peaks
twice each binary orbit. The amount of flux variation is strongly influenced by
the disk geometry. We suggest that these flux variations produce several
observable signatures, and that these observables may provide constraints on
different properties of the disk such as its vertical structure, geometry, and
cooling rate.

### [8] [Dust and Water in V883 Ori: Relics of a Retreating Snowline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27468)
*Yu Wang,Chris W. Ormel,Hao-Chang Jiang,Sebastiaan Krijt,Adrien Houge,Enrique Macías*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: V883 Ori系统的ALMA观测显示50-70 au处的强度肩部和80 au以外的扩展水蒸气发射，这些特征被解释为后退的雪线遗迹，而非传统的尘埃堆积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释V883 Ori系统中观测到的强度肩部和扩展水蒸气发射特征，这些特征与传统的雪线尘埃堆积模型不符。

Method: 构建二维盘模型，模拟爆发后冷却阶段的水蒸气再凝结过程，计算移动凝结前沿的动力学。

Result: 强度肩部由移动凝结前沿的蒸气再凝结产生的过剩表面密度形成，外层水蒸气库因大气层再凝结时间尺度长（10^2-10^3年）而持续存在。

Conclusion: 观测特征是后退雪线的自然遗迹，预测强度肩部将在25年内向内迁移10 au。

Abstract: V883 Ori is an FU-Orionis-type outburst system characterized by a shoulder at
50-70 au in its ALMA band 6 and 7 intensity profiles. Previously, this feature
was attributed to dust pile-up from pebble disintegration at the water
snowline. However, recent multi-wavelength observations show continuity in the
spectral index across the expected snowline region, disfavoring abrupt changes
in grain properties. Moreover, extended water emission is detected beyond 80
au, pointing to a snowline further out. This Letter aims to explain both
features with a model in which the snowline is receding. We construct a 2D disk
model that solves the cooling and subsequent vapor recondensation during the
post-outburst dimming phase. Our results show that both the intensity shoulder
and the extended water emission are natural relics of a retreating snowline:
the shoulder arises from excess surface density generated by vapor
recondensation at the moving condensation front, while the outer water vapor
reservoir persists due to the long recondensation timescales of $10^{2}-10^{3}$
yr at the disk atmosphere. As V883 Ori continues to fade, we predict that the
intensity shoulder will migrate inward by an observationally significant amount
of 10 au over about 25 years.

*Mariam R. Alshamsi,Mashhoor A. Al-Wardat*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 利用阿联酋火星任务Hope航天器的EXI仪器观测数据，研究了火星MY36年期间背风波云的日变化分布和频率，发现背风波云活动在下午时段和特定太阳经度范围内最为活跃。

Motivation: 理解火星背风波云的日变化行为对于了解火星中尺度大气动力学及其与地表地形的相互作用至关重要。

Method: 使用阿联酋火星任务Hope航天器上的EXI仪器在MY36年期间的观测数据，识别了50个背风波云事件并分析其时空分布模式。

Result: 共识别出50个背风波云事件，活动在下午时段（太阳经度270-360度之间）达到峰值，显示出明显的季节性和当地时间依赖性。

Abstract: Understanding the diurnal behavior of lee wave clouds on Mars provides
critical insight into the planet's mesoscale atmospheric dynamics and their
interaction with surface topography. Lee wave clouds exhibit distinct spatial
and temporal patterns that vary over the Martian day. In this study, we
investigate the diurnal distribution and frequency of lee wave cloud activity
during Martian Year (MY) 36 using observations from the EXI instrument aboard
the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" spacecraft. A total of 50 lee wave
events were identified, with a pronounced peak in activity during afternoon
hours between solar longitudes (Ls) 270 deg and 360 deg. Our analysis reveals a
seasonal and local-time dependence for these clouds, providing a comparative
framework with previous mission datasets. These findings not only enhance the
current understanding of Martian weather processes but also support future
efforts to model and predict terrain-induced cloud dynamics across key
locations on Mars.
