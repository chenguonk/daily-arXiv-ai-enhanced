We have discovered two faint comoving companions to young stars ISO-Oph 96 and 2MASS J16262785-2625152. The companion to ISO-Oph 96, KOINTREAU-3b, is at a projected separation of 340 au (2.49\"). Using our NIRC2 photometry and evolutionary models, and assuming that the companion has the same extinction as its host star, we infer that KOINTREAU-3b has a mass of $3.4\\pm0.7$ M$_{\\rm Jup}$. The companion to 2MASS J16262785-2625152, KOINTREAU-4b, has a projected separation of 180 au (1.25\") and could have a mass of either $11.5^{+1.2}_{-1.6}$ M$_{\\rm Jup}$ or $15.3^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ M$_{\\rm Jup}$, depending on whether the host star is a member of $ρ$ Oph or Upper Sco."}

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "As a byproduct of sub-Neptune formation, planetary embryos with high eccentricity can remain in outer orbits, near 1 au from the star. In this work, we investigate the long-term evolution of systems consisting of close-in sub-Neptunes (SNs) and outer high-eccentricity embryos. Our analysis focuses on collisions between SNs and embryos, particularly their atmospheric mass loss. We performed N-body simulations for various initial eccentricities and numbers of embryos. We analyzed the impact-induced atmospheric loss using post-processing methods, finding that the embryos and SNs collide at high speeds on timescales of several million years, leading to the loss of the SNs' atmospheres. Depending on the embryos' eccentricity and the orbital radius of the SNs, the impact velocity can be quite high, ranging from 2 to 5 times the escape velocity. On average, about 15%-30% of the atmosphere is dissipated per collision, so after 3-6 collisions, the atmospheric mass of an SN is reduced to about 1/3 of its initial value. Collisions between SNs and embryos can thus explain the presence of planets within the radius gap. Depending upon the initial eccentricity and the number of remaining embryos, additional collisions can occur, potentially accounting for the formation of the radius gap. This study also indicates that collisions between remaining embryos and SNs may help to explain the observed rarity of SNs with atmospheric mass fractions greater than 10%, commonly termed the \"radius cliff.\""}

Its atmospheric properties have been thoroughly investigated through low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic observations, enabling robust characterization of the planet's bulk parameters. However, the planet's intrinsically high contrast renders high-resolution spectroscopic observations difficult, despite their potential to yield key measurements essential for a more comprehensive characterization. This study seeks to constrain the planet's radial velocity, enabling a full 3D orbital solution when integrated with previous measurements. We have obtained 4 high-contrast high-resolution (R = 140000) spectroscopic datasets of the planet, collected over a two-year interval with the HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT to derive the planet's radial velocity. Using self-consistent models of atmosphere, we were able to derive the radial velocity of the planet at each of the 4 epochs. These radial velocity measurements were then used in combination with all existing relative astrometry in order to constrain the orbit of the planet. Our radial velocity measurements allow us to break the degeneracy along the line of sight, making it now possible the unambiguous interpretation of the phase curve of the companion. We further constrain the orbital parameters, particularly the eccentricity, for which we derive e = 0.55 (-0.07, +0.03). The relatively high eccentricity indicates that the system has experienced dynamical interactions induced by an external perturber. We place constraints on the mass and semi-major axis of a hypothetical, unseen outer planet capable of producing the observed high eccentricities."}

Inner (r < 3 au) disk planetary carbon compositions are strongly influenced by supply and survival of carbonaceous solids. Here we trace the journey of carbon from the interstellar medium to the processes leading to planet formation. The review highlights the following central aspects:\n  -Organics forming in evolved star envelopes are supplemented by aromatic molecules forming in the dense ISM to represent the seeds of (hydro)carbon supply through pervasive pebble drift to rocky planets and sub-Neptune cores.\n  -Within the protoplanetary disk the sharp gradient in the C/Si content of Solar System bodies and mineral geochemistry outlines a tale of carbon loss from pebbles to within planetesimals and planets, and from planetary atmospheres.\n  -Within two planet formation paradigms (pebble and planetesimal accretion) a range of planetary carbon content is possible that is strongly influenced by early (< 0.5 Myr) formation of a pressure bump that titrates drift.\n  Overall, it is unlikely that the carbon architecture of our Solar System applies to all systems. In the absence of giant planets, carbon-rich rocky worlds and sub-Neptunes may be common. We outline observations that support their presence and discuss habitability of terrestrial worlds."}

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Context: JWST has enabled transmission spectroscopy at unprecedented precision, but stellar heterogeneities (spots and faculae) remain a dominant contamination source that can bias atmospheric retrievals if uncorrected. Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $χ^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets."}

More Generic Climate Feedback Configurations Still Allow Temperate Climates in Habitable Zone Exo-Earth Candidates", "comment": "29 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal", "summary": "Earth's climate is influenced by over a dozen feedbacks, but only three dominate its long-term climate behavior. Models of the exoplanet habitable zone (HZ) assume that this is similar for other Earth-like planets. We used dynamical simulations to study Earth-like planets with a fourth, (potentially strong) generalized climate feedback. Across over 20,000 climate simulations, we find that the addition of the fourth feedback produces novel behaviors, including runaway and chaotic climate trajectories, that are more diverse than one would expect based on Earth's climate configuration. Non-negligible fourth feedbacks -- if negative -- would not lessen the probability of planets with temperate climates. However, positive fourth feedbacks decrease the fraction of exo-Earth candidates that are long-term habitable. Therefore, strong fourth feedbacks will alter (and mostly shrink) the boundaries of the classical habitable zone. When combined with occurrence rates of Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars, our results imply that the fraction of stars hosting rocky planets with temperate climates may be substantially lower than classical estimates under Earth-like climate assumptions. Our results are subject to the validity of the model assumptions and not intended to represent conclusive predictions about exoplanet populations but rather to demonstrate the potential climate diversity that emerges from non-Earth-like model configurations. Our conclusions provide context on sample sizes and science questions for next-generation exoplanet surveys."}

The influence on the episodic instability of the inner rim is hereby of central interest. 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models are employed to simulate the evolution of the inner disc over several thousand years. Our simulations greatly expand on previous models by implementing detailed opacity descriptions in terms of their mean and frequency-dependent values, allowing us to also consider binned frequency-dependent irradiation. The adaptive opacity description significantly affects the structure of the inner disc rim, with gas opacities exerting the greatest influence. The resulting effects include shifts in the position of both the dust sublimation front and the dead zone inner edge, a significantly altered temperature in the dust-free region and the manifestation of an equilibrium temperature degeneracy as a sharp temperature transition. The episodic instability due to MRI activation in the dead zone still occurs, but at lower inner disc densities. While the gas opacities set the initial conditions for the instability, the evolution of the outburst itself is mainly governed by the dust opacities. The analysis of criteria for non-axisymmetric instabilities reveals possible breaking of the density peaks produced by the burst. However, due to the periodicity of the instability, the inner edge itself may remain stable throughout quiescent phases according to linear criteria. Although the thermal structure of the inner disc is crucially affected by different opacity descriptions, the mechanism of the periodic instability of the DZIE remains active and is only marginally influenced by gas opacities. The observational consequences of the severely altered temperatures may be significant and require further investigation."}

Long-term N-body integrations show that most orbits with the retrograde configuration remain dynamically stable for at least 10 Myr, while orbits with the prograde motion might rapidly evolve into chaos or lead to ejection. The retrograde architecture points to a violent dynamical history, possibly involving von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles or three-body scattering, while the prograde scenario might be consistent with coplanar and mild disk migration. Future Gaia DR4 astrometry will break the inclination degeneracy and distinguish between prograde and retrograde orbits for HD 164604 c."}

Previous studies have suggested a positive connection between these two populations, particularly around metal-rich stars, and proposed that nearly all CJ-hosting stars may also harbor inner SEs. In this work, we use TESS transits to investigate the occurrence of hot SEs in systems with known CJs detected by radial velocity (RV). Out of a statistical sample of 132 CJ systems, we identify five transiting hot super-Earths ($1$-$4R_\\oplus$, $P<10\\mathrm{d}$) around four stars, including one new candidate (TOI-6965.01) around HD 50554. To enable statistical analysis, we first validate the two candidates around HD 50554 using TESS photometry, archival RV measurements, and Gaia astrometry. After accounting for detection sensitivity and geometric transit probability, we find that the presence of CJs enhances the occurrence rate of hot super-Earths by a factor of $8.1^{+4.3}_{-3.2}$ relative to field stars, with the case of no enhancement ruled out at the 99.9% confidence level. Taking into account the average multiplicity of hot SEs, we find that about 87% of CJ systems host at least one hot SE. Our results provide strong supporting evidence for a positive SE-CJ correlation. We also briefly explore the correlation around metal-poor hosts and for specific sub-populations (e.g., warm super-Earths or cold super-Jupiters)."}
