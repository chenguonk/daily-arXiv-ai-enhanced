This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star \"starring\" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called \"arm-crossing companion formation\" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem."}

Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $<$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$σ$ occurrence rate upper limit of $<$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $<$10 days, is lower than the $<$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $<$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $<$8 days is below the $<$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $η_{extragalactic}$ $\\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way."}

Yet, the lack of an observationally-derived temperature profile has left this balance unconstrained. We used four epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 (275-373 GHz) and Band 8 (385-500 GHz) SO$_2$ spectroscopy to retrieve Io's vertical atmospheric temperature profiles. To mitigate longstanding degeneracies common in atmospheric retrievals, we performed a simultaneous multi-line analysis combined with line-of-sight disk-resolved Doppler velocity maps and a forward model that included a sub-beam velocity-dispersion term. This modeling approach enabled the separation of thermal and dynamical line-shape contributions. On the leading hemisphere, we retrieved a cold, quasi-isothermal lower atmosphere ($\\sim$124-137~K up to $\\sim$0.5~nbar), followed by a thermospheric rise reaching hundreds of kelvins by $\\sim10^{-2}$~nbar. On the trailing hemisphere, our fits yielded qualitatively similar profiles but consistently retrieved lower SO$_2$ column densities. The lower column densities confined line formation to the first few kilometers, making the trailing hemisphere spectra statistically consistent with an isothermal atmosphere. Across datasets, we retrieved fractional gas coverages of $\\sim$35-50$\\%$ and sub-beam velocity dispersions of $\\sim$25-85$\\mathrm{~m~s^{-1}}$, encoding line-of-sight velocity dispersion within a beam element in excess of the disk-resolved Doppler velocity map. Together, these retrievals deliver the first vertically resolved temperature profiles of Io's atmosphere, reveal robust vertical structure on the dayside leading hemisphere, and offer new constraints on Io's thermal energy balance."}

Resolving this ambiguity is critical for accurate energy estimates and source reconstruction. In this study, we address this challenge by analyzing a unique regional dataset of well-constrained meteoroid events observed by the Southern Ontario Meteor Network and the co-located Elginfield Infrasound Array. We employ pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) simulations to quantify how fine-scale gravity-wave structures in the stratosphere and lower thermosphere modify acoustic waveforms at ranges <300 km. Our modeling reveals that while fine-scale layering can stretch signals and generate diffuse oscillatory tails, it does not produce discrete, high-amplitude pulse splitting at ranges below ~140 km. By applying these results to the rare multi-arrival event 20060305, we demonstrate that its distinct double arrival at 100 km range is inconsistent with atmospheric multipathing and provides definitive evidence of separate fragmentation episodes. These findings establish new diagnostic criteria for separating source physics from propagation artifacts, improving the reliability of infrasound as a monitoring tool for natural bolides, space debris re-entries, and catastrophic launch failures."}

This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near Ådalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition. Our analysis identifies distinct aerodynamic properties of iron meteoroids compared to stony bodies, including the influence of streamlined shapes and deep regmaglypts on drag and flight stability, underscoring the need to incorporate iron-specific parameters into entry models to constrain atmospheric dynamics and improve recovery predictions for future events."}

Hot Jupiters are ideal natural laboratories to investigate atmospheric composition and dynamics. However, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy is currently limited by our capability of removing planet-occulted line-distortion (POLD) contamination from the signal. Aims. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transmission spectrum of WASP-31 b from two and a half transits observed with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT. Methods. The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signature was analyzed using the RM \"revolutions\" method. Before extracting the transmission spectrum of the planet, we corrected the dataset for telluric lines using molecfit and further modeled the POLD deformations using EvE. Results. We confirm the planet low sky-projected spin-orbit angle from previous studies and further refine its value to $λ= -0.09^{+0.31}_{-0.32}$ deg. We do not detect any species (including previously detected species such as K or CrH) in the planetary atmosphere. In most cases the non-detections are due to the strong POLDs contamination or lack of observable lines in the ESPRESSO wavelength range, and so previous detections cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. Planet-occulted line-distortion contamination continues to be the main limitation of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for species present in both the star and the planet, hindering atmospheric detections even with state-of-the-art models, in particular for planets with a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle. Developing advanced techniques to isolate planetary signatures is of utmost importance in the advent of ELT-like observations."}

Accepted for publication in Space Science Reviews (Topical collection \"Geoscience of Exoplanets\")", "summary": "Volatile loss from exoplanetary atmospheres and its possible implications for the longevity of habitable surface conditions is a topic of vigorous debate currently. The vast majority of the habitable zone terrestrial-like exoplanets known to date orbit low-mass M- and K-dwarf stars and are subject to the conditions drastically different to those of terrestrial planets in the Solar System. In particular, they orbit far closer to their host stars than similar planets around G-dwarfs similar to the Sun. Therefore they receive higher X-ray and UV fluxes, even though luminosities of M- and K-dwarfs are lower than those of heavier stars. Furthermore, due to their slower evolution, M-dwarfs retain high activity on the gigayear timescales. The combination of these two effects has led to claims that most terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs may have their atmospheres stripped from the higher X-ray and UV fluxes of their host stars. Opposing this are researchers who point out that volatile inventories for terrestrial exoplanets are ill-constrained, and hence, they may be able to \"weather the storm\" of these higher X-ray and UV fluxes. In this chapter, we focus on exploring volatile loss in the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets in our solar system and applications to those in exoplanetary systems around stars of different types."}

Article accepted for publication in Earth, Planets and Space", "summary": "Nozomi was Japan's first space mission to Mars, launched on 3 July 1998 UT. It was equipped with the Mars Dust Counter (MDC) which was an impact ionisation dust detector. MDC detected 96 dust particle impacts when the spacecraft was in Earth orbit and later in interplanetary space, before its operation ended in April 2002 due to a technical failure on board. We compare the Nozomi dust measurements with the dust measurements obtained with the dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Impact speeds and masses of dust particles measured by Nozomi MDC are overall consistent with the measurements obtained by Ulysses in the same region of interplanetary space. Based on the impact speeds measured while Nozomi was in Earth orbit, MDC detected neither dust particles of natural origin that were bound to the Earth nor space debris. The dust impact rate measured in interplanetary space varied by approximately a factor of 2, consistent with theoretical predictions by the Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model. The particle impact direction was concentrated towards the ecliptic plane, in agreement with an interplanetary origin of the majority of the measured dust particles. No impacts of cometary trail particles could positively be identified during known cometary trail crossings of Nozomi. The Nozomi dust data may become a valuable reference for the dust measurements to be obtained in the same region of interplanetary space with future space missions like, for example, MMX and DESTINY$^+$."}
