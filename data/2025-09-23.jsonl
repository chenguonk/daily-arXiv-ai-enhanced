Stellar obliquity is commonly used to\ndistinguish them, as high obliquity often accompanies HEM. However, low\nobliquity does not guarantee disk migration, due to possible spin-orbit\nrealignment or coplanar HEM. Seeking a proxy for disk migration, we investigate\nthe idea that when the circularization timescale of a planet on circular orbit\nis longer than its age ($\\tau_\\mathrm{cir} > \\tau_\\mathrm{age}$), HEM would not\nhave had sufficient time to complete, favoring disk migration. We empirically\ncalibrate the reduced planetary tidal quality factor to be\n$Q_\\mathrm{p}=4.9^{+3.5}_{-2.5}\\times10^5$ using the eccentricity distribution\nof 500+ Jovian mass ($0.2M_\\mathrm{J}<M_\\mathrm{p}<13M_\\mathrm{J}$) planets\nwith measured masses and radii, a value consistent with solar system Jupiter.\nWe then calculate $\\tau_\\mathrm{cir}$ and identify dozens of disk migration\ncandidates ($\\tau_\\mathrm{cir} > \\tau_\\mathrm{age}, \\ e < 0.1$). These planets\nshow three notable trends. We first find a clear cutoff of obliquity at\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{cir} \\sim \\tau_\\mathrm{age}$, suggesting the primordial alignment\nof protoplanetary disks. Secondly, we find that among hot Jupiters ($a<0.1$\nau), nearby companions are preferentially found around disk migration\ncandidates, suggesting that either HEM dominates hot Jupiter formation, or disk\nmigration also disrupts nearby companions at short separations. Finally, we\nfind a possible dearth of disk migration candidates around mass ratio $\\log q\n\\sim -3.2$, consistent with a similar dip suggested at longer orbits from\nmicrolensing. The lack of planets across different orbital distance, if true,\ncould be interpreted as a hint of runaway migration."}

The\nmajority of current models treat these planets as homogeneous or contain\nheterogeneity that is constant in time. In reality, habitable exoplanets are\nexpected to contain atmospheric and surface heterogeneities similar to Earth,\nwith diurnal rotation, seasonal changes, and weather patterns resulting in\ncomplex, time-dependent signatures. Due to its ability to measure light as a\nvector, polarimetry provides an important tool that will enhance the\ncharacterizations of heterogeneous worlds. Here we model the visible to\nnear-infrared linear spectropolarimetric signatures, as functions of wavelength\nand planetary phase angle, of various heterogeneous Earth scenarios as well as\nthe first signals of an early wet and potentially habitable Mars. The\ncontributions from the different atmospheric and surface properties result in\nasymmetric phase curves and variable spectra, with the polarization appearing\nto be more sensitive than flux to heterogeneities such as patchy clouds and\ncontinents moving into and out-of-view.

To\nimprove the precision in orbital properties, precursor radial velocity (RV)\nfollow-up observations for selected candidates are essential. This study\nexamines the impact of three variables on the orbital period uncertainties of\nlong-period giant planets: the number of future observations, the temporal gap\nbetween past and future data, and the temporal coverage of upcoming\nobservations. Our simulations indicate that the orbital phases at which future\nRV observations are acquired play a significant role in reducing period\nuncertainties. Additionally, observing too frequently within a given time frame\nadds limited value to the program once a certain number of observations has\nbeen achieved. The temporal gap proves to be the most important factor when\nthere is no strict end time to the observing campaign. However, if a strict end\ntime is set, starting observations earlier yields improved reductions in\norbital period uncertainty.

The\nNIR cooling system was originally conceived to operate with a discontinuous\nflow of cryogenic nitrogen gas. As part of CARMENES-PLUS, this was upgraded to\na continuous flow configuration. Additional changes included the installation\nof an automatic vacuum system, a proportional control valve, and a pressure\nregulation system. These upgrades were designed to reduce thermal fluctuations\nand enhance long-term stability. The implemented upgrades significantly\nimproved the intrinsic RV precision of the NIR channel.
