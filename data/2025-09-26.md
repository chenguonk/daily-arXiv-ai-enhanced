TL;DR: 该研究分析了147颗暖巨行星的重元素含量，发现重元素质量遵循特定关系，挑战了经典的核心吸积模型，表明巨行星在气体吸积阶段仍会继续吸积富含重元素的物质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巨行星积累固体和气体的速率是行星形成模型的关键组成部分，但很难从第一原理预测。表征巨行星的重元素含量可以提供关于其起源的重要线索。

Method: 使用热演化模型，更新了H-He状态方程和随包层金属丰度变化的大气边界条件，量化了147颗暖巨行星（温度<1000K）的总体重元素含量。

Result: 发现重元素质量关系为M_Z = M_core + f_Z(M_p - M_core)，其中M_core = 14.7±1.6地球质量，f_Z = 0.09±0.01。经典核心吸积模型与观测结果不一致。

Conclusion: 巨行星在气体吸积阶段继续吸积富含重元素的物质，重元素含量在高质量行星中趋于稳定，约为太阳金属丰度的7倍。

Abstract: The rate at which giant planets accumulate solids and gas is a critical
component of planet formation models, yet it is extremely challenging to
predict from first principles. Characterizing the heavy element (everything
other than hydrogen and helium) content of giant planets provides important
clues about their provenance. Using thermal evolution models with updated H-He
EOS and atmospheric boundary condition that varies with envelope metallicity,
we quantify the bulk heavy element content of 147 warm ($< 1000$ K) giant
planets with well-measured masses and radii, more than tripling the sample size
studied in Thorngren et al. 2016. These measurements reveal that the
population's heavy element mass follows the relation $M_{\rm Z} = M_{\rm core}
+ f_Z (M_{\rm p} - M_{\rm core})$, with $M_{\rm core} = 14.7^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$
Earth masses (M$_\oplus$), $f_Z = 0.09 \pm 0.01$, and an astrophysical scatter
of $0.66 \pm 0.08 \times M_Z$. The classical core-accretion scenario ($Z_{\rm
p} = 1$ at 10 M$_\oplus$ and $Z_{\rm p} = 0.5$ at 20 M$_\oplus$) is
inconsistent with the population. At low planet masses ($<< 150$ M$_\oplus$),
$M_{\rm Z} \sim M_{\rm core}$ and as a result, $Z_{\rm p} = M_{\rm Z} / M_{\rm
p}$ declines linearly with $M_{\rm p}$. However, bulk metallicity does not
continue to decline with planet mass and instead flattens out at $f_Z \sim
0.09$ ($\sim 7 \times$ solar metallicity). When normalized by stellar
metallicity, $Z_{\rm p} / Z_\star$ flattens out at $3.3 \pm 0.5$ at high planet
masses. This explicitly shows that giant planets continue to accrete material
enriched in heavy elements during the gas accretion phase.

TL;DR: 该研究通过内部结构建模探索亚海王星表面条件，发现相当一部分亚海王星可能没有现今的岩浆海洋，而是具有固态硅酸盐表面，特别是那些具有高大气平均分子量和大气质量分数的行星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚海王星的演化和结构可能受到行星外层气体包层与表面岩浆海洋之间相互作用的强烈影响，但尚不清楚这些行星是否总是存在熔融硅酸盐层。

Method: 使用内部结构建模方法，对亚海王星群体在不同整体和大气参数下的表面条件进行广泛探索。

Result: 发现具有高大气平均分子量和大包层质量分数的行星更可能具有固态硅酸盐表面，因为包层-地幔边界处的压力足够高，硅酸盐将处于固态后钙钛矿相。

Conclusion: 该分析为解释亚海王星及其大气提供了关键背景，表明许多亚海王星可能不具备现今的岩浆海洋，这对JWST观测结果的解释具有重要意义。

Abstract: The evolution and structure of sub-Neptunes may be strongly influenced by
interactions between the outer gaseous envelope of the planet and a surface
magma ocean. However, given the wide variety of permissible interior structures
of these planets, it is unclear whether conditions at the envelope-mantle
boundary will always permit a molten silicate layer, or whether some
sub-Neptunes might instead host a solid silicate surface. In this work, we use
internal structure modeling to perform an extensive exploration of surface
conditions within the sub-Neptune population across a range of bulk and
atmospheric parameters. We find that a significant portion of the population
may lack present-day magma oceans. In particular, planets with a high
atmospheric mean molecular weight and large envelope mass fraction are likely
to instead have a solid silicate surface, since the pressure at the
envelope-mantle boundary is high enough that the silicates will be in solid
post-perovskite phase. This result is particularly relevant given recent
inferences of high-mean molecular weight atmospheres from JWST observations of
several sub-Neptunes. We apply this approach to a number of sub-Neptunes with
existing or upcoming JWST observations, and find that in almost all cases, a
range of solutions exist which do not possess a present-day magma ocean. Our
analysis provides critical context for interpreting sub-Neptunes and their
atmospheres.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse
environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally
intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains
neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the
first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide
solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and
successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and
propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion
interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally
eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging
to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced
machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of
complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to
traditional numerical simulations in the future.

*Alexandros Ziampras,Amelia J. Cordwell,Roman R. Rafikov,Richard P. Nelson*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究比较了2D和3D模型在行星-盘相互作用中的差异，特别是热力学处理方式对间隙形成效率的影响。研究发现2D模型能够准确捕捉间隙形成的关键物理过程，简化冷却方案可以替代复杂的全辐射传输模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测到的原行星盘中的环状和间隙结构通常归因于嵌入的行星，但现有模型多采用简化的热力学假设。辐射冷却和子午面过程在行星-盘相互作用中起关键作用，但计算成本限制了相关研究。

Method: 使用2D和3D流体动力学模拟，比较不同热力学处理方法：局部等温、绝热、局部β冷却和包含辐射扩散的全辐射模型。通过比较行星螺旋产生的角动量沉积来评估间隙形成效率。

Result: 2D模型能够准确捕捉间隙形成的关键物理，即使包含全辐射传输。简化冷却方案可以捕捉全辐射模型的趋势，但在行星附近略微高估间隙形成效率。3D效应如垂直流动解释了两种方法的差异，但对间隙形成影响不大。

Conclusion: 鼓励在行星-盘相互作用研究中包含辐射过程，即使使用简化但有物理依据的冷却方案替代全辐射传输。这对于ALMA敏感盘区域(>10 au)中产生子结构的行星研究尤为重要。

Abstract: The ring and gap structures found in observed protoplanetary disks are often
attributed to embedded gap-opening planets and typically modeled with
simplified thermodynamics in the 2D, thin disk approximation. However, it has
been shown that radiative cooling and meridional processes play key roles in
planet-disk interaction, though their computational cost has limited their
exploration. We investigate the differences between 2D and 3D models of
gap-opening planets while also comparing thermodynamical frameworks ranging
from locally isothermal to fully radiative. We also compare simplified cooling
recipes to fully radiative models in an effort to motivate the inclusion of
radiative effects in future modeling even in a parametrized manner. We perform
hydrodynamical simulations in both 2D and 3D, and then compare the angular
momentum deposition by planetary spirals to assess gap opening efficiency. We
repeat comparisons with different thermodynamical treatments: locally
isothermal, adiabatic, local $\beta$ cooling, and fully radiative including
radiative diffusion. We find that 2D models are able to capture the essential
physics of gap opening with remarkable accuracy, even when including full
radiation transport in both cases. Simple cooling prescriptions can capture the
trends found in fully radiative models, albeit slightly overestimating gap
opening efficiency near the planet. Inherently 3D effects such as vertical
flows that cannot be captured in 2D can explain the differences between the two
approaches, but do not impact gap opening significantly. Our findings encourage
the use of models that include radiative processes in the study of planet-disk
interaction, even with simplified yet physically motivated cooling
prescriptions in lieu of full radiation transport. This is particularly
important in the context of substructure-inducing planets in the ALMA-sensitive
disk regions (>10 au).

TL;DR: 该研究比较了彗星与原始恒星区域IRAS 16293-2422B的分子丰度比，发现彗星中许多分子的丰度比相对于原始恒星有所增强，特别是复杂COH分子和含氮分子，表明彗星可能保留了部分星际冰物质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 彗星与星际介质冰的相似组成表明其分子可能继承自演化早期阶段，研究旨在量化彗星中保留原始星际物质的程度。

Method: 通过比较多个彗星与原始恒星区域IRAS 16293-2422B的分子丰度比，分析其相关性及差异。

Result: 彗星中复杂COH分子（如HCOOH、CH3CHO、HCOOCH3）和含氮分子（HC3N/CH3CN、HCN/CH3CN）的丰度比相对增强，而SO和SO2相对于H2S增强，OCS/H2S降低。超过84%的COH分子可由原始恒星组成解释，而含氮分子仅26-74%。

Conclusion: 彗星可能保留了相当比例的原始星际冰物质，特别是COH分子，这为确定彗星中盘处理物质的相对程度提供了可能途径。

Abstract: Comets have similar compositions to interstellar medium ices, suggesting at
least some of their molecules maybe inherited from an earlier stage of
evolution. To investigate the degree to which this might have occurred we
compare the composition of individual comets to that of the well-studied
protostellar region IRAS 16293-2422B. We show that the observed molecular
abundance ratios in several comets correlate well with those observed in the
protostellar source. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cometary
abundances are identical to protostellar. We find the abundance ratios of many
molecules present in comets are enhanced compared to their protostellar
counterparts. For COH-molecules, the data suggest higher abundances relative to
methanol of more complex species, e.g. HCOOH, CH3CHO, and HCOOCH3, are found in
comets. For N-bearing molecules, the ratio of nitriles relative to CH3CN --
HC3N/CH3CN and HCN/CH3CN -- tend to be enhanced. The abundances of cometary SO
and SO2 relative to H2S are enhanced, whereas OCS/H2S is reduced. Using a
subset of comets with a common set of observed molecules we suggest a possible
means of determining the relative degree to which they retain interstellar
ices. This analysis suggests that over 84% of COH-bearing molecules can be
explained by the protostellar composition. The possible fraction inherited from
the protostellar region is lower for N-molecules at only 26--74%. While this is
still speculative, especially since few comets have large numbers of observed
molecules, it provides a possible route for determining the relative degree to
which comets contain disk-processed material.

TL;DR: 本文结合高精度天体测量和径向速度数据，改进了GQ Lup B（一个约30木星质量、距离约100 au的伴星）的轨道参数，发现其轨道与主星盘和自转轴存在显著倾斜，支持云碎片形成的形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解巨行星轨道对于检验行星形成模型至关重要，特别是在大于10 au的宽分离区域，传统核心吸积效率低下。但在这些分离距离上约束轨道参数一直具有挑战性。

Method: 使用CRIRES+的高分辨率光谱测量、SPHERE、NACO和ALMA的天体测量数据，以及新的高精度GRAVITY天体测量数据，结合径向速度数据来改进GQ Lup B的轨道约束。

Result: 结合径向速度和GRAVITY数据后，轨道偏心率从0.47改进为0.35。轨道与星周盘倾斜63度，与主星自转轴倾斜52度，但与宽伴星GQ Lup C盘的倾角更为一致（34度）。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持GQ Lup B的形成机制与云碎片形成一致，并展示了结合伴星径向速度约束与干涉天体测量在探测宽轨道亚恒星伴星动力学和形成方面的强大能力。

Abstract: Understanding the orbits of giant planets is critical for testing planet
formation models, particularly at wide separations greater than 10 au where
traditional core accretion becomes inefficient. However, constraining orbits at
these separations has been challenging because of sparse orbital coverage and
degeneracies in the orbital parameters. We use existing high-resolution
spectroscopic measurements from CRIRES+ (R ~ 100000), astrometric data from
SPHERE, NACO, and ALMA, and new high-precision GRAVITY astrometry to refine the
orbit of GQ Lup B, a ~30 M_J companion at ~100 au, in a system that also hosts
a circumstellar disk and a wide companion, GQ Lup C. Including radial velocity
data significantly improves orbital constraints by breaking the degeneracy
between inclination and eccentricity that affects astrometry-only fits for
long-period companions. This work is among the first to combine high-precision
astrometry with the companion's relative radial velocity to achieve improved
orbital constraints. The eccentricity is refined from e = 0.47 (+0.14, -0.16)
with GRAVITY alone to e = 0.35 (+0.10, -0.09) when RVs and GRAVITY data are
combined. The orbit is misaligned by 63 (+6, -14) deg relative to the
circumstellar disk and 52 (+19, -24) deg relative to the host star spin axis,
and is more consistent (34 (+6, -13) deg) with the inclination of the wide
tertiary companion GQ Lup C disk. These results support a formation scenario
for GQ Lup B consistent with cloud fragmentation and highlight the power of
combining companion RV constraints with interferometric astrometry to probe the
dynamics and formation of wide-orbit substellar companions.

### [7] [The depletion of the asteroid belt and the impact history of the Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21194)
*Julio A. Fernandez*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文评估了小行星带物质流失速率及其在宏观天体与流星尘埃之间的分配，发现当前流失速率约为碰撞活跃质量的8.8×10⁻⁵ Ma⁻¹，其中20%为宏观天体，80%为尘埃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小行星带物质流失过程及其对地球等类地行星撞击历史的影响，探索过去小行星带质量变化与地质记录的关联。

Method: 通过分析小行星碎片进入不稳定动力学区域（与木星、土星、火星的平运动共振或长期共振）的过程，计算物质流失速率，并假设25%的黄道尘埃来自小行星带。

Result: 当前小行星带质量流失速率适中，但若计算值被低估，过去3.5亿年前可能存在指数级增长的质量流失，与地质记录中更强烈的撞击事件相符。

Conclusion: 小行星带物质流失速率的历史变化可能解释了地球等行星的撞击历史，但结果对计算参数敏感，需进一步验证。

Abstract: We have evaluated the rate at which the asteroid belt is losing material, and
how it splits between macroscopic bodies and meteoritic dust. The mass loss
process is due to the injection of asteroid fragments into unstable dynamical
regions, associated to mean-motion resonances with Jupiter, Saturn and Mars or
secular resonances, from where they are scattered either to the region of the
terrestrial planets or to the vicinity of Jupiter's orbit. Asteroid fragments
that do not escape from the belt are ground down by mutual collisions to
meteoritic dust. Under the assumption that 25\% of the zodiacal dust mass is of
asteroidal origin, we find that the asteroid belt is currently losing a
fraction of about $\mu_o \simeq 8.8 \times 10^{-5}$ Ma$^{-1}$ of its
collisionally-active mass (without the primordial objects Ceres, Vesta and
Pallas), about 20\% as macroscopic bodies, and 80\% as dust particles that feed
the zodiacal dust cloud. Extrapolation of the current mass loss rate to the
past suggests only a moderate increase of the asteroid belt mass and the mass
loss rate around 3.0 - 3.5 Ga ago (by about 50\% and a factor of two
respectively). Yet, should the computed $\mu_o$ be somewhat underestimated
owing to the different uncertainties associated to its computation, the
extrapolation to the past would lead to quite different results. For instance,
a moderate increase in the computed $\mu_o$, say by a factor of three, would
lead to an exponential increase of the asteroid mass and mass loss rate about
3.5 Ga ago. A greater asteroid mass loss rate in the past should be correlated
with a more intense impact rate of the Earth, Moon and the other terrestrial
planets, which is indeed what suggests the geologic record (Hartmann 2007).

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了恒星金属丰度对类太阳恒星自转和活动演化以及相应系外行星大气演化的影响，发现金属丰度高的恒星自转减慢更快，其宜居带内行星接收的XUV辐射更强，大气蒸发更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解系外行星大气演化是研究宜居性的关键问题，而大气蒸发受恒星XUV辐射影响。目前尚未研究恒星金属丰度对恒星活动/行星大气演化的影响。

Method: 通过建模研究恒星金属丰度对类太阳恒星自转和活动演化的影响，以及相应系外行星大气演化过程。

Result: 金属丰度高的恒星自转减慢更快；金属丰度高的恒星宜居带内行星接收的XUV辐射更强，大气蒸发更快；对质量较高的类太阳恒星，金属丰度对大气演化的影响比初始自转周期更大。

Conclusion: 恒星金属丰度是影响系外行星大气演化的重要因素，特别是在高质量恒星中，其影响甚至超过恒星初始自转周期。

Abstract: Understanding how exoplanet atmospheres evolve is a key question in the
context of habitability. One key process governing this evolution is
atmospheric evaporation by stellar X-ray and EUV emission (collectively, XUV).
As such, the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres is closely tied to the
evolution of the host star's magnetic activity. Many studies have modelled the
combined evolution of exoplanet atmospheres and their host stars. However, to
date, the impact of the host star's metallicity on stellar activity/exoplanet
atmosphere evolution has not been explored. In this work, we investigate how
stellar metallicity affects the rotation and activity evolution of solar-like
stars as well as the corresponding exoplanet atmospheric evolution. We
reconfirm previous results that metal-rich stars spin down more rapidly than
metal-poor stars. We also find that the XUV flux that an exoplanet in the
habitable zone of its host star receives is larger when the host star is more
metal-rich. As such, the atmospheres of exoplanets in the habitable zones of
metal-rich stars are evaporated more rapidly than exoplanets in the habitable
zones of metal-poor stars. Lastly, we find that the atmospheric evolution is
most sensitive to the host star metallicity when the host star has a higher
mass. In the highest mass solar-stars, the metallicity can have a larger
influence on the atmospheric evolution than the initial rotation period of the
star.
