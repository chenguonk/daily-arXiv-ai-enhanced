Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth's orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth's atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts."}

Most implementations use either Jacobi coordinates or democratic heliocentric coordinates (DHC) for the Hamiltonian splitting, resulting in slightly different algorithms. In this paper we report results from numerical experiments, which show that integrations of the Solar System using DHC coordinates with typical timesteps of a few days suppress instabilities of the planet Mercury. We further show that this is due to an eccentricity dependent artificial numerical precession introduced by the DHC splitting. While the DHC splitting converges to the correct results at shorter timesteps of ~0.6 days, we argue that Jacobi coordinates remain reliable to significantly longer timesteps when orbits become moderately eccentric, and are thus a better choice when the innermost planet can reach high eccentricities."}

Refractory species, like sulfur, are only present in solids in the protoplanetary disk where planets form. Measuring their abundance in planetary atmospheres is one of the most direct ways of constraining the extent and mechanism of solid accretion. Using the unprecedented sensitivity of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we measure a detailed chemical make-up of three massive gas giants orbiting the star HR~8799 including direct detections of H$_2$O, CO, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, H$_2$S, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. We find these planets are uniformly and highly enriched in heavy elements compared to the star irrespective of their volatile (carbon and oxygen) or refractory (sulfur) nature, which strongly suggests efficient accretion of solids during their formation. This composition closely resembles that of Jupiter and Saturn and demonstrates that this enrichment also occurs in systems of multiple gas giant planets orbiting stars beyond the Solar System. This discovery hints at a shared origin for the heavy element enrichment of giant planets across a wider range of planet masses and orbital separations than previously anticipated."}

Previous work estimated its surface age to be between 200 and 1000 Myr. This estimate, however, is based on crater scaling laws for water and sand, which are not representative of the composition of Titan's icy surface. Titan's surface is likely composed of water ice, methane clathrates, or a combination of both. Here, we perform impact simulations for impactors of various sizes that strike an icy target with a 0-15 km thick methane clathrate cap layer. We derive new crater scaling laws based on our numerical results, and find that Titan's surface age is 300-340 Myr, assuming heliocentric impactors and surface clathrates. This age, which represents the crater retention age, indicates a relatively youthful surface, suggesting that active endogenic and/or exogenic processes have recently reshaped Titan's surface."}

Naver and K. W. Nikolajsen have contributed equally", "summary": "The next great leap in Martian exploration will be the return of samples to Earth. To ensure the maximum scientific return from studying these samples, the development and utilisation of nondestructive analytical techniques are essential to enable early three-dimensional characterisation of their interiors. Neutron computed tomography is a powerful method in this context: it is highly sensitive to hydrogen and complements the more conventional X-ray computed tomography. Because the distribution and nature of hydrous phases are central to understanding the habitability, the climatic and geological evolution, and potential biosignatures of Mars, identifying hydrogenbearing phases in Martian crustal rocks is of particular importance. Using the only Martian crustal material available on Earth, the NWA 7034 meteorite and its pairs, we show that combined neutron and X-ray computed tomography enables non-destructive sample-wide mapping of hydrogen and reveals the distribution and petrographic contexts of hydrous phases. We identify hydrogen-rich iron oxyhydroxides within ancient igneous clasts, forming a macroscopic mineralogical water reservoir within the meteorite. These alteration assemblages closely resemble those observed in samples collected by the Perseverance rover in Jezero crater, where hydrated iron oxyhydroxides are also present. This similarity suggests that such phases may represent a widespread near-surface water reservoir on early Mars."}

Accurately accounting for the effects of aerosols is key to reconstructing atmospheric properties from transit spectra, yet this remains a significant challenge. To advance this effort, it is invaluable to examine the spectral features of well-characterized planetary atmospheres. Here, we synthesize empirical transit spectra of Mars across different seasons based on data from the NOMAD's Solar Occultation channel onboard ExoMars/TGO, which operates at wavelengths of 0.2-0.65 and 2-4 micron. In the generated empirical transit spectra, the atmosphere below 25 km is found to be largely opaque due to the presence of micron-sized dust and water ice clouds, both of which substantially weaken spectral features. The spectra exhibit CO2 absorption features at 2.7-2.8 micron and signatures of sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds around 3.1 micron, accompanied by a continuum slope. The amplitudes of these spectral features are found to vary with the Martian seasons, where the dust storms weaken the CO2 signatures and strengthen the water ice features, which serve as potential indicators of a dusty planet like Mars. If TRAPPIST-1f possessed a Mars-like atmospheric structure, both CO2 and water ice features would be detectable at a noise level of 3 ppm, a level likely beyond current observational capabilities. Nevertheless, the 3.1 micron feature produced by sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds offers a novel avenue for characterizing the atmospheres of habitable-zone exoplanets."}

The method estimates the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal to recover both the signal intensity and the Doppler shift. The received signal power is estimated at 1-sec cadence which enhances the sensitivity and detection of the signal at lower altitudes of Venus, even in regions of high atmospheric opacity. After correcting total attenuation for refractive losses, absorption by known microwave absorbers is removed, leaving a residual signal attributable to sulfuric acid vapor. Two different methods of estimating the absorption due to Sulfur Dioxide have been presented, including one which incorporates in-situ data, which should better constrain the sulfuric acid vapor abundance below the clouds. Retrieved profiles for altitudes of 40 - 50 km reveal an increasing vapor abundance to more than 10 ppm below the clouds, and a sharp decline above 50 km in line with the expected saturation profile. These measurements agree with current models of the Venusian cloud structure and composition, and demonstrate that RO data, when coupled with optimized spectral analysis, can yield quantitative constraints on trace absorbers in optically thick atmospheres."}

Using imaging polarimeters, we measured the degree of linear polarization from the visible RC band (0.64 μm) to the near-infrared KS band (2.25 μm), and investigated its dependence on solar phase angle (polarization phase curve; PPC) and wavelength (polarization color curve; PCC). We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 μm and peaks at 1.5-2.0 μm, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks."}
