For planets orbiting rapidly rotating, and consequently oblate, host stars, photometric light curves provide a unique opportunity to measure the spin-orbit angle. Moreover, in systems with significant spin-orbit misalignment, the stellar oblateness can induce observable orbital precession. We wish to study the atmosphere and orbital architecture of an ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, orbiting around a hot A-type star. We use the photometric phase curves and gravity-darkened transits of WASP-189 b observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), complemented with the archival observations from CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). We detected a phase curve signal with significant occultation depth of 203.4 (+16.2) (-16.3) ppm, while the nightside flux, -71.8 (+36.4) (-36.0) ppm, is consistent with zero at 2-sigma. We invert the phase curve signal to construct the temperature map of the planet. The map was subsequently used to estimate the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency, the expected median ranges of which are found to be 0.19-0.35 and 0.09-0.41, respectively. Finally, we analysed gravity-darkened transits to find that the planet is in polar orbit with the spin-orbit angle of 89.46 (+1.08) (-1.08) deg. We found no hint of orbital precession while comparing our results with those from the literature. Our observations, together with atmospheric modelling, suggest that the dayside emission of WASP-189 b in TESS and CHEOPS bandpasses is dominated by thermal emission from an atmosphere with extremely inefficient heat transport and negligible contribution from reflected light."}

Detection Rates of Multiplanetary Systems in High Magnification Microlensing Events", "comment": "14 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to A&A", "summary": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will expand the reach of gravitational microlensing surveys by increasing the number of events monitored and the precision of their light curves. We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $χ^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \\sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey."}

We have found two faint ($Δ$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\\pm$1 but is ~4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118° difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution."}

Differentiating Earth from Neptunes During Discovery", "comment": "28 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication to AJ", "summary": "As the architecture for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is being developed, it is crucial to optimize the observing strategies for a survey to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Efficient target identification and characterization will help drive mission requirements that can be matched to the planned observations. Current HWO concepts allow simultaneous multi-bandpass observations with the coronagraph instrument, critical for performing a qualitative planetary reconnaissance to optimize observing time for deriving orbital constraints and prioritize characterization of promising targets.\n  We describe a new algorithm designed to determine the best combination of broadband photometric observations for extracting maximum information from the first visit. It identifies degeneracies in the orbital configurations, fluxes, and noise, and determines optimal secondary photometry bands to reduce these. We demonstrate its application by comparing an Earth seen at quadrature with a cold and a warm Neptune at inclined orbits and varying phases, with comparable flux in the discovery bandpass centered at 500 nm (20\\% bandwidth). Using the noise and exposure time calculator that we developed for the HWO coronagraph instrument, we find that the baseline $S/N=7$ (corresponding to 3.2 hours observing time for a planet at 10pc) is only sufficient to marginally differentiate the Earth from a cold Neptune-like planet assuming two parallel bandpasses (550 nm + 850 nm). However, increasing to $S/N=15$ (7 hours observing time) and using three parallel bandpasses (360 nm + 500 nm + 1.11 micron) would differentiate the Earth from either a warm or cold Neptune."}

Precise geometric calibration is critical for this mission, particularly due to PolCam's highly oblique viewing geometry, which introduces significant topographic distortion. We present a comprehensive on-orbit geometric calibration that relies on 160,256 tie points derived from matching features between PolCam images and the well-orthorectified global map of the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI). This dataset allows us to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the accurate reconstruction of the observation time for each line of an observation strip via a simple linear model, and (2) the refinement of the precise camera model, geometric model for PolCam optics. Our optimization method for these two challenges transforms the 2D image coordinates of identified features into 3D lunar coordinates and minimizes the reprojection error against the reference coordinates provided by the Kaguya MI map. From the refined observation time and camera model, we compute the precise longitude, latitude, and elevation of each pixel of an observed image. These estimated 3D coordinates are then used to generate orthorectified images, the final product of the geometric calibration. The resulting calibration achieves a geometric precision comparable to that of previous lunar orbiters and establishes the foundational framework necessary to produce geometrically-corrected data products of PolCam."}

Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "This study investigates the signatures of pressure extrema on global oscillations in discs. To this end, we use the framework of wave topology to establish a generalised local dispersion relation that includes pressure gradients. We highlight the influence of a previously unrecognized epicyclic-acoustic frequency and derive an analytical criterion for the existence of a branch of modes transiting between the inertial and the pressure bands. We find that pressure extrema consist of wave guides in which such topological modes propagate. The fundamental mode trapped at a pressure bump can propagate at all frequencies, allowing it to resonate with any temporal forcing, while the mode associated with a pressure gap propagates at a fixed frequency, propagates with arbitrary vertical phase velocity. These specific features make them attractive candidates for future discoseismology."}

To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem."}

One possibility is that sub-Neptunes have silicate/iron interiors and H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, i.e., they are `gas dwarfs'. If gas dwarfs have molten interiors, interactions between their magma oceans and atmospheres will produce distinct observational signatures. These signatures may break the degeneracy in interior structure, while providing insight into their interior processes, history, and population trends. We expect all such planets are born molten, but under what conditions do they remain molten today? We use the coupled interior-climate evolution model, PROTEUS, to estimate the `solidification shoreline': the instellation flux boundary (as a function of stellar $T_{\\rm eff}$) that separates molten gas dwarfs from solidified ones. Our results show that 98\\% of detected sub-Neptunes occupy a region of parameter space consistent with their having permanent magma oceans, if they are gas dwarfs. While mantle $f{\\rm O}_2$ and bulk volatile C/H ratio both influence magma ocean lifetimes, planets with oxidising mantles and carbon-rich atmospheres are unlikely to have radii consistent with the sub-Neptune classification. Therefore, most detected sub-Neptunes (if they are gas dwarfs) have permanent magma oceans. This result motivates further research into the interactions between molten interiors and overlying atmospheres, and campaigns to identify unambiguous signatures of these interactions."}

We computed second-order analytical expressions to make the transformation between the two systems and applied them to the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). If one term of the spin axis Cartesian coordinates series is dominant, trigonometric series can be generated for the inertial and orbital obliquities, node longitude and offset with respect to the Cassini plane. Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data."}
