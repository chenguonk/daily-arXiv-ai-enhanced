The small number of young systems with measured obliquities limits statistical conclusions. Here we determine the sky-projected obliquity ($λ$) of the 3 Myr transiting planet with a misaligned outer protoplanetary disk, TIDYE-1 b (IRAS 04125+2902 b), using the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Our dataset lacks a pre-transit baseline and ingress, complicating a blind RM fit. Instead, we use contemporaneous spectra and photometry from a mass-measurement campaign to model the stellar activity trend across the transit and provide an external prior on the velocity baseline. We determine $|λ|=11.8^{+5.9\\,\\circ}_{-5.0}$. Combined with the published rotational velocity of the star, we find a true three-dimensional obliquity of $ψ=15.2^{+7.3\\,\\circ}_{-5.7}$. Our result is consistent with an aligned orbit, suggesting the planet remains aligned to its star even though the outer disk is misaligned, though additional RM observations are needed to exclude the low-probability tail of misaligned ($>30^{\\circ}$) scenarios present in our posterior."}

This study examines how such perturbations influence the most eccentric comets in the Oort Cloud (OC), a thermalized reservoir of $\\sim 10^{12}$ icy bodies extending from $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ AU. Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr. Using analytical estimates and direct $N$-body simulations, we quantify how these encounters modify highly eccentric orbits: individual flybys enhance comet-shower rates by factors of about 2, producing a cumulative increase of roughly 40 over a Myr. In parallel, we perform a full dynamical search through all stars with six-dimensional phase-space data in Gaia DR3 and identify a compelling candidate for a long-period stellar companion to the Sun. This star exhibits recurrent $\\sim 45$ Myr perihelion passages and, in simulations, can elevate comet-shower activity by an order of magnitude. Because a perturber of this kind could also be a dispersed solar sibling, the companion hypothesis links the dynamical structure of the OC directly to the long-standing problem of identifying the Sun's birth-cluster relatives. The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test. Together, these results clarify how both stochastic encounters and potential long-period companions shape the dynamical evolution and observable output of the outermost OC, while highlighting the possibility that the OC retains a dynamical memory of the Sun's earliest stellar environment."}

Despite being crucial to understand their impact on observations and on the planetary radiative budget, the refractive indices of these haze particles are unknown and strongly influenced by changes in the gas phase chemistry. In this study, we perform a cross-laboratory investigation to assess the effect of the experimental set-up and gas composition on the refractive indices of Titan, Pluto and exoplanet haze analogs. We report new data in a broad spectral range from UV to far-IR (up to 200 microns) for future use in climate models and retrieval frameworks."}

A Search for Exomoons", "comment": "Submitted to AAS Journals", "summary": "We present a search for exomoons around the Jupiter-like exoplanet Kepler-167e using a NIRSpec JWST transit. Our 60 hour time series clearly reveals the enormous impact of long-term trends in NIRSpec data, specifically a gradual flux drift occurring over each of six 10 hour exposures. We weighed the evidence for exomoons by comparing a planet-only model with a planet+moon model for a grid of twelve different analysis choices. Our grid was comprised of three different reduction pipelines and four different models for the exposure-long trends - two using linear models and two using Gaussian processes. Seven grid realizations indicate a strong exomoon detection, typically favoring a Roche-skimming orbit roughly 10% the size of the planet. We find that the only likely real astrophysical feature driving these fits is a syzygy-like event occurring almost exactly mid-transit, which is highly ambiguous with a spot-crossing event. Indeed, we show that a spot of the necessary size is compatible with the earlier Kepler data. Ironically, the fact that JWST is so superior to Kepler means that our fits are effectively driven by a single transit - a regime in which exomoons have enormous freedom to explain non-Gaussian behavior. We thus strongly urge the next transit be observed in October 2027 to break these degeneracies. Our pilot study to seek transiting exomoons with JWST reveals the profound impact exposure-long trends exert - a cautionary tale for future analyzes of this data - as well as the need for a deeper understanding of this systematic's cause and modeling best-practices."}
