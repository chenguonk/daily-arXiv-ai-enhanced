A leading\nexplanation invokes perturbations from distant companions, i.e., the Eccentric\nKozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, which can excite the eccentricities of initially\nwide-orbiting planets to values of order unity. The resulting tidal dissipation\nat periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbits to their observed\nconfigurations. While observations of orbital misalignment and distant\ncompanions support this scenario, theoretical models have struggled to\nreproduce the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate. Population synthesis\nstudies often predict that many source \"cold Jupiters\" are destroyed by tidal\ndisruption during highly eccentric passages. We revisit this question with\nimproved treatments of the mass loss and angular momentum return experienced by\ntidally perturbed planets. Numerical studies are performed by combining secular\ndynamical evolution with planetary structural evolution using Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We also use an analytical approach\nto estimate rates of tidal disruption and hot Jupiter survival. Our new\npopulation synthesis studies of giant planets in stellar binaries show that\nimproved treatment of tidal mass loss enhances hot Jupiter survival by a factor\nof $\\sim2-3$, yielding occurrence rates ($\\gtrsim 0.5\\%$ around FGK stars)\nconsistent with observations. Angular momentum return from mass accreted onto\nthe star may also produce a pileup of hot Jupiters near three-day orbital\nperiods that is in statistical agreement with observations. These results\nsuggest that EKL-driven high-eccentricity migration, when combined with\nrealistic planetary mass loss, may be a dominant channel for hot Jupiter\nformation."}

However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose\naccuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical\nsimplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade\nthe accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal\ncandidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined\nphysical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and\nhigh-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations.\nWe developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer\nneural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of\nsolar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric\ntwo-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the\ntraditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer\nwith machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate\nroutines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs."}

With\nbroader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has\nenabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of\nphotochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable\nof navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In\nthis work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which\nemploys both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and\nleverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also\nincorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical\nspecies like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission\nobservations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place\nrobust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and\npotential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with\nnon-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O\nand -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The\nsecond best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium\nchemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42\n(+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding\nto approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval\nalso constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible\nabsorption features in the 7-8 microns range.

Sample return missions\nhave started to change that, as returned materials are already available to\nstudy. Still the available meteorites provide a valuable source of information\nabout the diversity of undifferentiated asteroids in the interplanetary space.\nTo improve compositional insights, we conducted Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass\nSpectrometry (ICP-MS) and ICP-AES (Inductively coupled Plasma Atomic Emission\nSpectroscopy) analyses on a representative suite of carbonaceous chondrites.\nThese meteorites, considered analogs of undifferentiated asteroids, preserve\nmaterials from the early solar system and provide a geochemical record of their\nparent bodies.

Stacking will be\nparticularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of\nthe same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet\ntransmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra\ngenerated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test\nthis by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward\nmodels over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\\mu$m). For two\ndominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately\nreflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across\nplanets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a\ncritical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$\nboundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within\ncomparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct\nsub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks\nrequired to rule out a flat spectrum at $>5\\sigma$, as a function of both cloud\ndeck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance\non when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in\nthe era of population studies of exoplanets."}

Previously, this feature\nwas attributed to dust pile-up from pebble disintegration at the water\nsnowline. However, recent multi-wavelength observations show continuity in the\nspectral index across the expected snowline region, disfavoring abrupt changes\nin grain properties. Moreover, extended water emission is detected beyond 80\nau, pointing to a snowline further out. This Letter aims to explain both\nfeatures with a model in which the snowline is receding. We construct a 2D disk\nmodel that solves the cooling and subsequent vapor recondensation during the\npost-outburst dimming phase. Our results show that both the intensity shoulder\nand the extended water emission are natural relics of a retreating snowline:\nthe shoulder arises from excess surface density generated by vapor\nrecondensation at the moving condensation front, while the outer water vapor\nreservoir persists due to the long recondensation timescales of $10^{2}-10^{3}$\nyr at the disk atmosphere. As V883 Ori continues to fade, we predict that the\nintensity shoulder will migrate inward by an observationally significant amount\nof 10 au over about 25 years."}
