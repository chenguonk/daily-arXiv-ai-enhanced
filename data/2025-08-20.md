Abstract: This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating
that Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks. Our model
builds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda
and Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability
(MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous
particle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard
planet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a
tandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and
outer edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The
inner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When
planetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate
outward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot =
10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI
edge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result
closely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and
Venus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong
support for our formation mechanism.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of planetary radii ordering within
multi-planet systems, namely their ordinal position with respect to their size
in a given system, utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. In addition,
we consider not only the ordinal positions but also the specific period ratios
and radius ratios of planetary pairs in multi-planet systems. We explore
various dependencies on stellar host type and metallicity, as well as planetary
types, and explore the differences between planetary systems with different
planet multiplicities and different planetary pairs in the same system.
Focusing on Kepler systems with two to four planets, we account for
observational biases and uncover a robust trend of smaller inner planets. This
trend is particularly pronounced in inner pairs of three-planet systems and
exhibits variations in stellar metallicity and planet multiplicity. Notably, we
find that the distribution of inner-to-outer planet radii ratios depends on the
system's metallicity, suggesting a link between initial conditions and the
resulting system architecture. Interestingly, planet pairs in resonance do not
exhibit significantly different size ratios compared to non-resonant pairs,
challenging current theoretical expectations, again, possibly suggesting that
initially resonant systems could have been later destabilized. Our findings
align with planet formation and migration models where larger planets form
farther out and migrate inward. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of
planet ordering as a novel and crucial observable for constraining planet
formation and evolution models. The observed patterns offer unique insights
into the complex interplay of formation, migration, and dynamical interactions
shaping planetary systems.

Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system
planets (i.e., Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for
Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data
collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of
geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To
correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we
adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the
planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and
calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across
wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each
planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we
simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134
systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of
10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging
instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and
Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used
the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color
reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work
improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of
exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then
serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation
for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging
missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.

TL;DR: 对HD 224018恒星系统的详细研究，通过多波段观测发现了比K2初始发现更多的行星，包括两颗亚海王星、一颗超级地球和一颗候选冷木星质量伴星

Result: 发现了四颗行星：两颗亚海王星（周期约138天和未知）、一颗超级地球（10.64天周期）、一颗候选冷木星质量伴星（8.6AU偏心轨道）；精确测量了第二颗亚海王星的密度为3.9±0.5 g/cm³

Conclusion: HD 224018系统包含三颗近距离凌星行星和一颗候选冷大质量伴星，需要进一步观测来完善行星物理性质和系统架构的特征描述

Abstract: In 2016, Kepler/K2 detected a system of two sub-Neptunes transiting the star
HD 224018, one of them showing a mono-transit event. In 2017, we began a
spectroscopic follow-up with HARPS-N to measure the dynamical masses of the
planets using radial velocities, and collected additional transit observations
using CHEOPS. We measured the fundamental physical parameters of the host star,
which is an ``old Sun'' analogue. We analysed radial velocities and photometric
time series, also including data by TESS, to provide precise ephemerides,
radii, masses, and bulk densities of the two planets, and possibly modeling
their internal structure and composition. The system turned out to be more
crowded than shown by K2. Radial velocities revealed the presence of two
additional bodies: a candidate cold companion on an eccentric orbit with a
minimum mass nearly half that of Jupiter (eccentricity $0.60^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$;
semi-major axis 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ au), and an innermost super-Earth (orbital
period 10.6413$\pm$0.0028 d; mass 4.1$\pm$0.8 Me) for which we discovered
previously undetected transit events in K2 photometry. TESS revealed a second
transit of one of the two companions originally observed by K2. This allowed us
to constrain its orbital period to a grid of values, the most likely being
$\sim$138 days, which would imply a mass less than 9 Me, at a 3$\sigma$
significance level. Given the level of precision of our measurements, we were
able to constrain the internal structure and composition of the second-most
distant planet from the host star, a warm sub-Neptune with a bulk density of
3.9$\pm$0.5 g/cm$^{3}$. HD 224018 hosts three close-in transiting planets in
the super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune regime, and a candidate cold and eccentric
massive companion. Additional follow-up is needed to better characterise the
physical properties of the planets and their architecture.

### [5] [Spatial variability of CH4 and C2H2 absorptions in Jupiter's auroral regions from Juno-UVS observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13706)

TL;DR: 利用Juno-UVS光谱仪数据研究木星極光大气中烃粮吸收特征，发现部分区域存在水平组成变化和同地圈高度差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析木星極光大气中CH4和C2H2吸收特征，探索烃粮吸收的水平和垂直变化，检测是否存在预期结构的偏移

Method: 利用Juno-UVS光谱仪数据，构建对CH4和C2H2吸收敏感的颜色比地图，重新定义CH4吸收波段(135-140nm)，开发高亮度区域的光谱扩展线性校正方法

Result: CH4和C2H2吸收基本遵循预期垂直分布，CH4密度扩展到更高高度。PJ6异常由仪器非线性引起，校正后与标准分布一致。PJ10异常持续存在，需要修改CH4和C2H2相对丰度来解释，表明存在水平组成变化和同地圈高度差异

Conclusion: 研究突出了在解释紫外極光光谱和推断电子能量分布时考虑本地大气组成变化的重要性，发现木星極光大气存在空间异质性

Abstract: Color ratios derived from molecular hydrogen emissions provide valuable
diagnostics for the energy of precipitating electrons and the structure of the
auroral atmosphere. We aim to characterize the horizontal and vertical
variability of hydrocarbon absorption in Jupiter's auroral atmosphere using
ultraviolet data from the Juno-UVS spectrograph and to investigate potential
departures from the expected structure. We constructed color ratio maps
sensitive to CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions for perijoves (PJs) 6 and 10,
two of Juno's close approaches to Jupiter, by integrating auroral H$_2$
emission over hydrocarbon-sensitive spectral intervals. For CH$_4$, we
redefined the absorbed spectral band, replacing the traditionally used 125-130
nm interval with 135-140 nm, in order to mitigate higher-order calibration
issues. In regions of intense auroral brightness, we developed a correction
method to account for spectral distortion due to detector non-linearities at
high fluxes. CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions generally follow the expected
vertical distribution, with the CH$_4$ density extending to higher altitudes
than C$_2$H$_2$. However, several localized regions show unexpected spatial
distribution of the absorption. In PJ6, such anomalies are attributed to
instrumental non-linearities. After correction, the CR distributions become
consistent with standard hydrocarbon vertical distributions. In PJ10, however,
some anomalous patterns persist despite correction. Spectral modeling indicates
that these can be explained by modifying the relative abundances of CH$_4$ and
C$_2$H$_2$, suggesting horizontal compositional variability and possible
deviations in homopause altitude between species. These findings underscore the
importance of accounting for local atmospheric composition when interpreting
ultraviolet auroral spectra and retrieving electron energy distributions.

### [6] [Simulation of Impact-induced seismic shaking on asteroid (25143) Itokawa to address its resurfacing process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13727)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过地震波传播模拟和滑坡模型，研究发现小行星Itokawa上Kamoi陨石坑的撞击引发的地震震动足以解释表面风化程度的空间变化，并揭示了其内部结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Itokawa小行星表面新鲜和成熟地形并存的现象，尽管其空间风化时间尺度仅约1000年，验证地震震动作为可能解释的假设。

Method: 进行三维地震波传播模拟，应用简化滑坡模型估算表面加速度和巨石位移，假设Kamoi陨石坑由近期撞击形成。

Result: 即使低能量情况（1%标称地震能量）也能产生足够使表面物质失稳的加速度；模拟位移与观测风化程度分布一致；估算地震扩散系数1000-2000 m²/s，地震效率5.0×10⁻⁸至5.0×10⁻⁷。

Conclusion: 地震震动能解释Itokawa表面风化多样性，内部含有数十米尺度块体，是强散射介质，支持撞击诱发地震震动导致表面更新的假设。

Abstract: The surface of asteroid (25143) Itokawa shows both fresh and mature terrains,
despite its short space weathering timescale of approximately 1000 years, as
inferred from recent studies. Seismic shaking triggered by the impact that
formed the 8-meter Kamoi crater has been proposed as a possible explanation for
the diversity. This study aims to examine whether the seismic shaking induced
by the impact could account for the observed spatial variations in space
weathering and further constrain the internal structure of Itokawa. Assuming
that the Kamoi crater was formed by a recent impact, we conducted
three-dimensional seismic wave propagation simulations and applied a simplified
landslide model to estimate surface accelerations and boulder displacements.
Our results show that even a low-energy case (1 % of the nominal seismic
energy) produces surface accelerations sufficient to destabilize the surface
materials. The simulated boulder displacements are consistent with the observed
distribution of space weathering degrees even on the opposite hemisphere. We
estimate the seismic diffusivity to be 1000-2000 m2 s-1 and the seismic
efficiency to be in the range of 5.0 x 10-8 to 5.0 x 10-7, implying that
Itokawa's interior contains blocks tens of meters across and acts as a strongly
scattering medium.

Abstract: Recent developments in computational power and machine learning techniques
motivate their use in many different astrophysical research areas.
Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify
exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves.
In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency
of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of
full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural
Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy
metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false
positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant
information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural
Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off.
We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS
have the best performance.
