Abstract: This thesis conducts a systematic review of the applications of Lagrange
points within the solar system, utilizing Systems Theory to frame these
applications in terms of their interdependencies and potential for integration
into broader space mission architectures. By analyzing various applications
across domains such as astronomical research, space exploration, space resource
utilizations, national defense, and space communication, this study identifies
key areas where Lagrange points offer significant advantages. The research
employs a qualitative analysis of existing literature combined with theoretical
modeling to demonstrate how these points can be optimally utilized in future
space missions. The finding suggests that a Systems Theory approach not only
clarifies the roles and benefits of Lagrange points in space mission design but
also reveals new pathways for enhancing mission efficiency and effectiveness.
This thesis underscores the importance of a holistic view in the strategic
planning of space missions and provides a foundational approach for integrating
Lagrange points into future exploratory and operational frameworks.

### [2] [The Photochemical Plausibility of Warm Exo-Titans Orbiting M-Dwarf Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10611)
*Sukrit Ranjan,Nicholas F. Wogan,Ana Glidden,Jingyu Wang,Kevin B. Stevenson,Nikole Lewis,Tommi Koskinen,Sara Seager,Hannah R. Wakeford,Roeland P. van der Marel*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: JWST观测M矮星小型系外行星光谱时，温暖系外泰坦（类土卫六行星）的甲烷寿命极短，检测概率低于0.1，需要更高证据标准来确认此类发现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST开始观测M矮星小型系外行星光谱，但光谱特征解释存在歧义，需要评估温暖系外泰坦（具有N2-CH4大气的类土卫六行星）的合理性

Method: 使用光化学模型研究温暖系外泰坦的甲烷寿命，以TRAPPIST-1e为案例研究，分析其相对于真实土卫六的甲烷寿命减少程度

Result: 温暖系外泰坦的甲烷寿命仅为真实土卫六的≤0.1倍（最可能≤0.02倍），绝对检测概率<0.1（最可能<0.01），与JWST未检测到温暖类地系外行星CH4主导大气的结果一致

Conclusion: 温暖系外泰坦检测的先验概率很低，需要更高的证据标准，观测到氧化碳物种可佐证此类发现，若确认存在将需要重新理解类泰坦世界的结构、动力学和光化学

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to spectrally characterize
small exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars, but interpretation of these spectra is
ambiguous, with stellar, instrumental, or atmospheric origins possible for
apparent spectral features. Consequently, interpretation of JWST small
exoplanet spectra follows a Bayesian approach, with less theoretically
plausible interpretations facing a higher burden of proof. Here, we use
photochemical modeling to evaluate the plausibility of warm exo-Titans,
exoplanets with N$_2$-CH$_4$ atmospheres analogous to Titan but orbiting closer
to their host stars. Consideration of warm exo-Titans is motivated by arguments
from planet formation, as well as tentative evidence from observations. Using
TRAPPIST-1e as a case study, we show that the higher instellation experienced
by warm exo-Titans reduces their CH$_4$ lifetime $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$
relative to true Titan by orders of magnitude, reducing the probability of
observing them. We constrain the $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ on a warm exo-Titan to
be $\leq0.1\times$ (and most likely $\leq0.02\times$) true Titan, implying the
absolute probability of detecting a warm exo-Titan is $<0.1$ and likely
$<0.01$. This finding is consistent with recent JWST nondetections of
CH$_4$-dominated atmospheres on warm terrestrial exoplanets. The low prior
probability means that the standard of proof required to claim a warm exo-Titan
detection is high, and we offer specific suggestions towards such a standard of
proof. Observation of oxidized carbon species would corroborate a putative warm
exo-Titan detection. Confirmed detection of warm exo-Titans would signal the
need to fundamentally rethink our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and
photochemistry of Titan-like worlds.

### [3] [LEO-Vetter: Fully Automated Flux- and Pixel-Level Vetting of TESS Planet Candidates to Support Occurrence Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10619)
*Michelle Kunimoto,Steve Bryson,Drayson Jaffee,Jason F. Rowe,Tansu Daylan,Steven Giacalone,Jack J. Lissauer,Michael R. B. Matesic,Susan E. Mullally,Yoshi Nike Emilia Eschen*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: LEO-Vetter是一个全自动的系外行星筛选系统，用于处理TESS卫星数据，能够高效识别行星候选体并支持统计稳健的人口统计研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TESS行星搜索需要大量人工检查，限制了研究范围，且人工筛选的主观性使得现有星表不适合人口统计研究

Method: 基于开普勒Robovetter设计，实现通量和像素级别的测试来排除噪声/系统误报和天体物理误报

Result: 在模拟数据上达到91%的完整性和97%的可靠性，处理20万个M矮星光变曲线后从2万个类凌星信号中筛选出172个行星候选体

Conclusion: LEO-Vetter使原本因时间或计算限制而无法进行的分析成为可能，用户可高效生成自己的TESS行星星表并进行完整性可靠性表征

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified several
thousand planet candidates orbiting a wide variety of stars, and has provided
an exciting opportunity for demographic studies. However, current TESS planet
searches require significant manual inspection efforts to identify planets
among the enormous number of detected transit-like signatures, which limits the
scope of such searches. Demographic studies also require a detailed
understanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet
populations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered
unsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a
publicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after
the Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of
promising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic
studies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against
noise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter
achieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic
false alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate
the usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and
reducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet
candidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical
to perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational
limitations. Users will be able to efficiently produce their own TESS planet
catalog starting with transit-like detections, as well as have the framework
needed to characterize their catalog's completeness and reliability for
occurrence rates.

### [4] [New constraint on Europa's ice shell: magnetic signature from the ocean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10903)
*Florentin Daniel,Ludovic Petitdemange,Christophe Gissinger*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 木卫二冰下海洋中的电磁驱动急流对热传输和冰层厚度变化有重要影响，研究为未来探测任务提供了预测和约束方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 木卫二被认为是地外生命最有希望的候选者之一，但其冰下海洋的流动过程和冰层厚度控制因素尚不完全清楚，特别是其导电海洋受木星时变磁场影响这一独特特征

Method: 研究电磁驱动急流对热通量的影响，分析热通量纬度分布与冰层厚度变化的关系，建立模型预测并与观测数据比较

Result: 电磁驱动急流在海洋顶部稳定分层区域有效传输热量，可能改变深层对流缩放规律，热通量纬度分布可用于预测冰层厚度变化

Conclusion: 研究为JUICE和Europa Clipper任务提供了重要参考，改进的测量精度将有助于进一步约束海洋特性并完善模型预测

Abstract: Jupiter's icy moons are believed to host subsurface liquid oceans, and among
them, Europa stands out as one of the most promising candidates for
extraterrestrial life. Yet, the processes driving oceanic flows beneath its ice
shell, as well as the factors controlling the thickness of this ice, remain
incompletely understood. One especially distinctive feature of Europa is that
its salty ocean is electrically conducting and thus influenced by Jupiter's
time-varying magnetic field, which is believed to drive a large-scale zonal
flow. Here, we examine hos this magnetically-induced jet affects both the heat
flux and the dynamics of the convective flow within Europa's ocean. We first
show that the magnetically-driven jet efficiently transports heat in stably
stratified regions near the top of the ocean, and may alter the expected
convective scaling laws in deeper layers. Second, by analysing the latitudinal
distribution of heat flux and relating it to ice-thickness variations, we make
predictions that can be compared with current observations. In anticipation of
the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions, we discuss how improved
measurement precision could help further constrain the ocean's properties and
refine our model-based forecasts.

### [5] [Hydrocarbon Hazes on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b supported by data from the James Webb Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10947)
*Ruohan Liu,Panayotis Lavvas,Giovanna Tinetti,Jesus Maldonado,Sushuang Ma,Arianna Saba*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 对K2-18b系外行星JWST观测数据的新分析，结合MIRI LRS和NIRISS/NIRSpec数据，发现该行星具有以氢气为主的大气层，存在碳氢化合物雾霾，甲烷和二氧化碳丰度低于无雾霾研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K2-18b是一颗位于M矮星宜居带内的亚海王星，此前哈勃和韦伯望远镜观测显示其具有可探测的大气特征。研究旨在重新解释JWST透射光谱数据，评估恒星参数不确定性对行星性质推断的影响。

Method: 结合MIRI LRS数据的独立还原和已发表的NIRISS/NIRSpec观测，使用实验室产生的雾霾类似物进行散射和吸收分析，进行基于平衡化学的自由化学贝叶斯反演。

Result: 推导出行星密度为3.34±1.44 g cm⁻³，大气以氢气为主，平均分子量约2.4道尔顿，在0.85-12 μm范围内存在碳氢化合物雾霾，甲烷和二氧化碳丰度系统性地低于无雾霾研究。

Conclusion: 需要后续自洽的光化学和微物理建模，以及进一步的中红外观测来约束关键碳氢化合物物种，较冷的解决方案（约250K）在行星质量降低时仍然可行。

Abstract: K2-18b, a sub-Neptune orbiting in the habitable zone of an M dwarf, has
attracted significant interest following observations with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) and, more recently, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
that reveal detectable atmospheric features. Previous studies have examined a
wide range of possible compositions, focusing primarily in the near-infrared
(0.8-5.2 $\mu$m) or mid-infrared (5-12 $\mu$m) wavelengths. We present a new
interpretation of K2-18b's JWST transit spectra, combining an independent
reduction of MIRI LRS data with previously published NIRISS/NIRSpec
observations. We assess the impact of stellar parameter uncertainties on the
inferred planetary properties and, using revised stellar parameters, derive a
planetary density of $\rho_P = 3.34 \pm 1.44$ g cm$^{-3}$. We consider
scattering and absorption from laboratory-produced haze analogues and perform
free-chemistry Bayesian retrievals informed by equilibrium chemistry. Our
results are consistent with an H$_2$-dominated mini-Neptune atmosphere with a
mean molecular weight of $\mu \sim$2.4 Daltons, and support the presence of
hydrocarbon hazes across 0.85-12 $\mu$m without requiring instrumental offsets.
Our retrieved CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ abundances are broadly consistent between
models but systematically lower than in haze-free studies, suggesting that haze
reduces the need for high-$\mu$ solutions. While our retrievals tend to favour
atmospheric temperatures $\sim$100-200 K warmer than previously reported,
cooler solutions ($\sim$250 K) remain viable if the planetary mass is reduced
towards the lower end of its uncertainty. We emphasise the need for follow-up
self-consistent photochemical and microphysical modelling, alongside further
mid-infrared observations to constrain key hydrocarbon species.

### [6] [Consistent Modeling of Non-equilibrium Dust Sublimation and the Interactions with Dust Evolution in the Inner Regions of Protoplanetary Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11036)
*Sheng Xu,Lile Wang,Luis C. Ho,Renyue Cen,Shenzhen Xu*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过DFT和KMC模拟发现硅酸盐尘埃升华是非平衡动力学过程，升华时间尺度远超局部动力学时间，导致尘埃在过热状态下持续存在，形成动态的升华前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上使用平衡热力学模型研究原行星盘内区尘埃升华过程，但需要验证这一假设的合理性。

Method: 采用从头算密度泛函理论(DFT)和动力学蒙特卡洛(KMC)模拟，计算MgSiO3等成分的结合能和振动频率，并耦合升华与平流、颗粒演化进行综合模拟。

Result: 发现升华前沿随吸积率在径向变化达四倍，呈现垂直分层的碗状结构，表明尘埃分布、热结构和行星形成受到尘埃运动学和动力学的深刻影响。

Conclusion: 原行星盘模型和内缘观测解释需要摒弃平衡假设，考虑尘埃颗粒的运动学和动力学效应。

Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are host to the sublimation of dust
grains, a process traditionally modeled using equilibrium thermodynamics. We
demonstrate through ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte
Carlo (KMC) simulations that silicate dust sublimation is inherently a
non-equilibrium kinetic process. The binding energies and vibrational
frequencies governing desorption, calculated for MgSiO3 and other compositions,
reveal that sublimation timescales far exceed local dynamical times, allowing
grains to persist in a superheated state. This kinetic inhibition results in a
broad, dynamic sublimation front whose location and morphology are strongly
regulated by radial advection and dust coagulation. Our coupled simulations,
integrating sublimation with advection and grain evolution, show that the front
varies radially by a factor of four with accretion rate and exhibits a
vertically stratified, bowl-shaped structure. These findings imply that the
inner disk dust distribution, thermal structure, and subsequent planet
formation are profoundly influenced by the kinematics and kinetics of dust
grains, necessitating a departure from equilibrium prescriptions in disk models
and interpretations of inner rim observations.

### [7] [Origin of the lunar farside highlands from Earthshine-induced global circulation in lunar magma ocean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11199)
*Wenshuai Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 月球背面高地形成机制的新理论：地球反照导致月球岩浆海洋全球环流，将斜长岩晶体从近侧输送到远侧，形成更厚的远侧地壳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释月球背面地壳比近侧更厚的现象，这一现象对月球形成演化理论构成挑战

Method: 提出地球反照（Earthshine）在月球达到同步自转后，通过表面温度梯度诱导月球岩浆海洋产生全球环流，分析环流模式对斜长岩晶体输运和结晶过程的影响

Result: 全球环流导致浅层岩浆海洋中岩浆从近侧流向远侧，深层则相反流向，这种流动将斜长岩晶体输送到远侧；远侧较低温度使结晶更高效，快速产生斜长岩晶体

Conclusion: 该理论为月球背面高地的起源提供了一种自然的解释机制，可能解决月球形成演化理论中的关键难题

Abstract: The lunar farside highlands, referred to as the lunar farside thicker crust
compared with the nearside crust, presents a challenge to the theory of
formation and evolution of the Moon. Here, we show that, after the Moon reached
synchronous rotation, Earthshine could induce global circulation in lunar magma
ocean due to the imposed surface temperature gradient generated by the hot,
post-giant impact Earth. The global circulation, generating downwellings on the
farside and a deeper return flow on the nearside, results that magmas flow from
the nearside to the farside in the shallow magma ocean while the the direction
of flow is opposite in the deep magma ocean. Such flow in the shallow magma
ocean would transport anorthositic crystals formed in the nearside to the
farside. Furthermore, since the lunar farside is cooler than the nearside,
crystallization is much more efficient at the farside, resulting that farside
magmas transported from the nearside produce anorthositic crystals rapidly. The
theory proposed here may provide a natural way of explaining the origin of the
lunar farside highlands.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文测量了TOI-2374 b行星的恒星自转倾角，发现其轨道与宿主恒星自转轴显著不对齐，支持海王星脊行星与热木星可能具有相似的形成机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究海王星脊行星（周期3-6天、大小介于海王星和土星之间的行星）的恒星自转倾角分布，以了解其形成机制是否与热木星相似

Method: 使用Keck Planet Finder进行光谱凌星观测，检测Rossiter-McLaughlin效应，并利用Tierras天文台的光度测量确定恒星自转周期

Result: 测量到TOI-2374 b的天空投影倾角λ=81°±23°，三维倾角ψ=85.9°±9°，表明其轨道与恒星自转轴几乎垂直，属于极轨道

Conclusion: 海王星脊行星的高倾角频率与长周期行星形成对比，这种模式与巨行星相似，暗示它们可能通过类似的动力学激发迁移路径形成

Abstract: The ``Neptunian ridge'' is a recently identified peak in the frequency of
planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn orbiting their host stars
with periods between 3 and 6 days (A. Castro-Gonz\'alez et al. 2024). These
planets may have formed similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in
the ``three-day pile-up'', through a dynamically excited migration pathway. The
distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune systems may therefore
provide a vital clue as to their origin. We report a new stellar obliquity
measurement for TOI-2374\,b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge ($P = 4.31$ days,
$R_p = 7.5 R_\oplus$). We observed a spectroscopic transit of TOI-2374 b with
the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an
amplitude of 3 m/s, and measured a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda =
{81^\circ}^{+23^\circ}_{-22^\circ}$, indicating an orbit significantly
misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A reloaded RM analysis of the
cross-correlation functions confirms this misalignment, measuring $\lambda =
{65^\circ}^{+32^\circ}_{-24^\circ}$. Additionally, we measured a stellar
rotation period of $P_\mathrm{rot} = 26.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days with photometry
from the Tierras observatory, allowing us to deduce the three-dimensional
stellar obliquity of $\psi = {85.9^\circ}^{+8.6^\circ}_{-9.2^\circ}$. TOI-2374
b joins a growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high frequency of
misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert planets, compared with their
longer period counterparts, is reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant
planets and may suggest a similar formation mechanism.

*Leonardo Braga,Andre Amarante,Alessandra Ferreira,Caio Gomes,Luis Ceranto*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用多面体模型分析67P彗星的表面和轨道动力学特性，包括引力势、逃逸速度、表面坡度、平衡点等，发现引力主导表面特性，识别了稳定平衡点和周期轨道族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究太阳系小天体的物理和动力学特性可以揭示其演化历史和起源，ESA的罗塞塔任务为详细研究67P彗星提供了宝贵机会。

Method: 应用多面体方法计算动力学表面特性，包括几何高度、表面倾斜度、坡度、引力势面等，并使用简化偶极子段模型研究动力学特性。

Result: 引力势在彗星表面占主导地位，Hapi区域逃逸速度最大，大部分表面坡度较低，识别了4个外部和1个内部平衡点（其中2个稳定），发现了12族平面对称周期轨道。

Conclusion: 67P彗星的缓慢旋转使其表面引力特性占主导，第三体扰动和太阳辐射压力对表面坡度影响有限，平衡点和周期轨道的发现为理解彗星动力学提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Small bodies in our Solar System are considered remnants of their early
formation. Studying their physical and dynamic properties can provide insights
into their evolution, stability, and origin. ESA's Rosetta mission successfully
landed and studied comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) for approximately two
years. In this work, the aim is to analyze the surface and orbital dynamics of
comet 67P in detail, using a suitable 3-D polyhedral shape model. We applied
the polyhedron method to calculate dynamic surface characteristics, including
geometric height, surface tilt, surface slopes, geopotential surface,
acceleration surface, escape speed, equilibrium points, and zero-velocity
curves. The results show that the gravitational potential is predominant on the
comet's surface due to its slow rotation. The escape speed has the maximum
value in the Hapi region (the comet's neck). The surface slopes were analyzed
to predict possible regions of particle motion and accumulation. The results
show that most regions of the comet's surface have low slopes. Furthermore, we
analyzed the slopes under the effects of Third-Body gravitational and Solar
Radiation Pressure perturbations. Our results showed that the effects of
Third-Body perturbations do not significantly affect the global behavior of
slopes. Meanwhile, the Solar Radiation Pressure does not significantly affect
particles across the surface of comet 67P with sizes $>\sim10^{-3}$\,cm at
apocenter and $>\sim10^{-1}$\,cm at pericenter. We also identified four
equilibrium points around comet 67P and one equilibrium point inside the body,
where points E$_2$ and E$_5$ are linearly stable. In addition, we approximated
the shape of comet 67P using the simplified Dipole Segment Model to study its
dynamics, employing parameters derived from its 3-D polyhedral shape model. We
found 12 families of planar symmetric periodic orbits around the body.

*D. González Picos,S. de Regt,S. Gandhi,N. Grasser,I. A. G. Snellen*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 利用JWST/NIRSpec对两颗年轻褐矮星进行大气和盘状结构分析，检测到20多种化学物种，测量了碳氧同位素比率，发现温暖的黑体环和热CO气体发射


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年轻褐矮星是巨行星的类似物，为大气和形成模型提供基准。JWST使获取褐矮星近红外光谱成为可能，旨在约束其化学成分、温度结构、同位素比率和盘发射

Method: 使用JWST/NIRSpec中分辨率光谱（0.97-5.27 μm），结合辐射传输、逐线不透明度、参数化温度剖面和灵活平衡化学进行反演和盘建模，包括黑体连续谱和光学薄CO发射的盘环

Result: 检测到20多种物种包括CO、H2O、CO2、SiO和氢化物；测量碳同位素比率12C/13C≈75-79，氧同位素比率16O/18O≈645-681；发现温暖（≈650K）黑体环和热气体（≥1600K）CO发射；大气C/O比率0.54-0.59，与太阳值一致

Conclusion: 通过联合约束温度、成分、同位素和盘，表征了两颗年轻褐矮星的大气和盘结构，证明了JWST/NIRSpec探测年轻天体和环行星盘的能力

Abstract: Young brown dwarfs serve as analogues of giant planets and provide benchmarks
for atmospheric and formation models. JWST has enabled access to near-infrared
spectra of brown dwarfs with unprecedented sensitivity. We aim to constrain
their chemical compositions, temperature structures, isotopic ratios, and disc
emission. We perform retrievals and disc modelling on JWST/NIRSpec
medium-resolution ($R \approx 2700$) spectra spanning 0.97--5.27 $\mu$m,
combining radiative transfer, line-by-line opacities, parameterised temperature
profiles, and flexible equilibrium chemistry. We include a disc ring with
blackbody continuum and optically thin CO emission. We detect over twenty
species, including $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, SiO, and hydrides. The CO band at
4.6 $\mu$m reveals $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O. Carbon isotope ratios are
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $79^{+14}_{-11}$ (TWA 27A) and $75^{+2}_{-2}$ (TWA 28);
oxygen ratios are $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = $645^{+80}_{-70}$ and $681^{+53}_{-50}$.
Both objects show excess infrared emission, consistent with warm ($\approx 650$
K) blackbody rings, and optically thin CO from hot gas ($\geq 1600$ K) needed
to match the red spectra. The atmospheric C/O ratios are $0.54 \pm 0.02$ (TWA
27A) and $0.59 \pm 0.02$ (TWA 28), consistent with solar values. We
characterise the atmospheres and discs of two young brown dwarfs through joint
constraints on temperature, composition, isotopes, and discs, demonstrating
JWST/NIRSpec's ability to probe young objects and circumplanetary discs.

### [11] [Dust trapping in protoplanetary discs after stellar flybys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11909)
*Vasundhara R. Prasad,Cristiano Longarini,Cathie J. Clarke*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 恒星飞掠事件在年轻恒星形成区很常见，可能造成原行星盘中的子结构。通过三维流体动力学模拟，研究发现飞掠扰动会在气体和尘埃盘中产生螺旋结构，显著提高局部尘埃与气体比例，足以触发流不稳定性并促进星子形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究恒星飞掠对原行星盘结构和尘埃聚集的影响，解释观测到的子结构形成机制，探索行星形成早期阶段的关键物理过程。

Method: 使用三维平滑粒子流体动力学（SPD）模拟，研究抛物线共面飞掠对尘埃捕获的影响，追踪单个尘埃粒子在飞掠诱导子结构中的行为。

Result: 发现顺行和逆行飞掠都会在气体和尘埃盘中产生螺旋结构，飞掠诱导子结构中的尘埃与气体比例显著高于未扰动盘，局部比例足够高以触发流不稳定性。

Conclusion: 恒星飞掠是原行星盘中子结构形成和行星esimal形成的重要机制，通过提高局部尘埃密度促进行星形成过程。

Abstract: Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and
could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs. Using
three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we study dust
trapping in discs perturbed by parabolic coplanar flybys. We find that spiral
structures are induced in the gas and dust discs for both prograde and
retrograde encounters. By tracking individual dust particles within the
flyby-induced substructures, we determine that they have a highly enhanced dust
to gas ratio compared to particles in an unperturbed disc. We further find that
the local dust to gas ratios in flyby-induced substructures are sufficiently
high to trigger the streaming instability and hence facilitate planetesimal
formation in young discs.

*Luis Thomas,Louise D. Nielsen,Lorena Acuña-Aguirre,Alex Cridland*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析28颗温暖亚土星的内部分布，发现包层质量分数(f_env)的双峰分布中存在间隙，这与核心吸积模型中失控吸积开始的临界点(f_env≈0.5)一致，支持了行星形成理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在核心吸积模型下，气态巨行星通过失控吸积形成，当吸积包层质量等于核心质量时开始这一过程。研究旨在通过分析亚土星内部结构来寻找其形成历史的印记。

Method: 使用GASTLI模型计算内部结构网格，对28颗亚土星样本进行反演推导包层质量分数(f_env)。针对低、中、高三种大气金属丰度假设分别进行反演，并将f_env分布与行星形成模型预测进行比较。

Result: 发现f_env存在双峰分布，间隙位置随大气金属丰度变化。高金属丰度情况下间隙位于f_env=0.5-0.7之间，与核心吸积模型预测一致。同时发现氢氦质量分数(f_H/He)在0.3处也存在间隙。

Conclusion: 亚土星的f_env分布特征支持核心吸积模型，特别是失控吸积开始的临界条件。不同区域的亚土星可能来自相同的母体种群，为行星形成机制提供了重要观测证据。

Abstract: Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This
process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass
of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for
imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS
gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure
models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to
derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three
different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 < log(Fe/H) < 0.5), medium ( 0.5 <
log(Fe/H) < 1.4), and high (1.4 < log(Fe/H) < 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The
distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of
planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal
accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric
metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we
find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is
located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric
metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the
$f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with
assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when
$M_{env} \approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal
distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap
at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed
atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our
sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the
Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of
savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the
same underlying population.
