We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for\nthe formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to\norbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it\nevolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation.\nWhen the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The\nevolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by\nperforming a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple\nnon-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that\nthe DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion\nformation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with\nplanetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range\nfrom the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to\nconsider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital\nmigration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred\npopulation of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a\nkey role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation."}

The Populations of Companions Formed Through Disc Instability", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We applied the global end-to-end model described in Paper~I of this series to\nperform a population synthesis of companions formed via disc instability (DI).\nBy using initial conditions compatible with both observations and\nhydrodynamical simulations, and by studying a large range of primary masses\n(0.05-5 Msol), we can provide quantitative predictions of the outcome of DI.\n  In the baseline population, we find that ~10 % of the discs fragment, and\nabout half of these end up with a surviving companion after 100 Myr. 75\\% of\nthe companions are in the brown dwarf regime, 15 % are low-mass stars, and 10 %\nplanets. At distances larger than ~100 au, DI produces planetary-mass\ncompanions on a low percent level. Inside of 100 AU, however, planetary-mass\ncompanions are very rare (low per mill level). The average companion mass is\n~30 Mj scaling weakly with stellar mass. Most of the initial fragments do not\nsurvive on a Myr timescale; they either collide with other fragments or are\nejected, resulting in a population of free-floating objects (about 1-2 per\nstar). We also quantify several variant populations to critically assess some\nof our assumptions used in the baseline population.\n  DI appears to be a key mechanism in the formation of distant companions with\nmasses ranging from low-mass stars down to the planetary regime, contributing,\nhowever, only marginally to planetary mass objects inside of 100 AU. Our\nresults are sensitive to a number of physical processes, which are not\ncompletely understood. Two of them, gas accretion and clump-clump collisions,\nare particularly important and need to be investigated further. Magnetic fields\nand heavy-element accretion have not been considered in our study, although\nthey are also expected to affect the inferred population. We suggest\nacknowledging the importance of the gravito-turbulent phase, which most\nprotoplanetary discs experience."}

This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that\nreveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible\nmanner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related\ntrajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion\nmodels to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions.\nWe then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the\naforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is\nemployed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model\nusing a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint\nviolations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for\nseparate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical\nexperiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve\nsample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of\nMarkov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa\ncircular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a\npartial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior\nPareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method\nfor a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a\nseparate dedicated global search."}

Catalog of Uniform Keplerian Fits to Radial Velocities of 200 Warm Jupiters", "comment": "ApJS, accepted", "summary": "Giant planets are expected to predominantly form beyond the water ice line\nand occasionally undergo inward migration. Unlike hot Jupiters, which can\nresult from high-eccentricity tidal migration, warm Jupiters between 0.1-1 AU\n($\\approx$10--365 d) are in many ways more challenging to explain because they\nreside outside the tidal influence of their host stars. Warm Jupiters should\ntherefore preserve traces of their origins as their eccentricities are directly\nrelated to their past interactions. We analyze the eccentricities of 200 warm\nJupiters orbiting 194 Sun-like host stars (with FGKM spectral types) using\n18,587 RV measurements across 40 high-resolution spectrographs. RVs are\ncompiled from the literature and are supplemented with 540 new observations\nfrom MINERVA-Australis at Mt. Kent Observatory and the Habitable-zone Planet\nFinder spectrograph at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which are\ntimed to improve eccentricity constraints by sampling orbits near periastron\npassage. The overarching goal of this program is to establish the relative\nimportance of giant planet migration channels through the largest homogeneous\nanalysis of warm Jupiter orbital properties to date. In particular, we evaluate\nand compare the impact of different system architectures and host star\ncharacteristics on the population-level eccentricity distributions of warm\nJupiters.

Correlations with Host Star Properties and Orbital Separation", "comment": "AJ, accepted", "summary": "Warm Jupiters with orbital periods of $\\approx$10-365 d represent a\npopulation of giant planets located well within the water ice line but beyond\nthe region of tidal influence of their host star relevant for high-eccentricity\ntidal migration. Orbital eccentricities offer important clues about the\nformation and dynamical history of warm Jupiters because in situ formation and\ndisk migration should imprint near-circular orbits whereas planet scattering\nshould excite eccentricities. Based on uniform Keplerian fits of 18,587 RVs\ntargeting 200 warm Jupiters, we use hierarchical Bayesian modeling to evaluate\nthe impact of host star metallicity, stellar mass, and orbital separation on\nthe reconstructed population-level eccentricity distributions. Warm Jupiters\ntake on a broad range of eccentricities, and their population-level\neccentricities are well modeled using a Beta distribution with $\\alpha$ =\n1.00$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ and $\\beta$ = 2.79$^{+0.28}_{-0.26}$. We find that\n27$^{+3}_{-4}\\%$ of warm Jupiters have eccentricities consistent with\nnear-circular orbits ($e$ $<$ 0.1), suggesting that most warm Jupiters\n(73$^{+3}_{-3}\\%$) detected are dynamically hot. Warm Jupiters orbiting\nmetal-rich stars are more eccentric than those orbiting metal-poor stars -- in\nagreement with earlier findings -- but no differences are observed as a\nfunction of stellar host mass or orbital separation, at least within the\ncharacteristic ranges probed by our sample ($\\approx$0.5--2.0 $M_{\\odot}$ and\n0.1--1 AU, respectively). In this sense, metallicity plays a larger role in\nshaping the underlying eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters than stellar\nmass or final orbital distance. These results are broadly consistent with\nplanet scattering playing a major role in shaping the orbital architectures of\nclose-in giant planets."}

To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this\ntechnique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct\npopulation-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated\nexoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a\nnatural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we\nquantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a\nsimulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test\ncases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive\nqualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for\nmid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many\nobservations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes\nthe need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find\nthat while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities,\nit will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order\natmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric,\nwe determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will\nbe able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of\nits lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have\nenormous ramifications for our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics.\nFinally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order\nto encourage future eclipse mapping studies."}
