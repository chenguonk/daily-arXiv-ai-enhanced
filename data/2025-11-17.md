*Eritas Yang,Yubo Su*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文通过分析偏心级联机制，阐明了热木星形成的高效迁移通道，无需初始轨道严格垂直的精细调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高偏心率迁移机制需要行星初始轨道与外部伴星几乎垂直的精细调节，本文旨在通过偏心级联机制绕过这种限制。

Method: 通过解析方法表征偏心级联的动力学特性，推导S型不稳定性的分析准则，获得EC启动的闭式表达式。

Result: 发现当内三重系统处于动力学不稳定边缘时，原热木星偏心率激发最有效；添加远距离第四体可渐进接近不稳定；该机制与双星系统中S型行星稳定性密切相关。

Conclusion: 偏心级联机制在广泛的中间扰动体参数范围内都能有效形成热木星，证明其作为一种稳健迁移通道的潜力。

Abstract: A widely explored pathway for hot Jupiter (HJ) formation is high-eccentricity migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles induced by an exterior companion. However, for a distant or low-mass companion, this mechanism typically demands that the planet's initial orbit be very nearly perpendicular to that of the companion. In previous work (Yang et al. 2025), we demonstrated that such fine-tuning can be circumvented in the HAT-P-7 system due to the presence of an intermediate body that efficiently couples the orbits of the planet and the distant companion -- a mechanism we termed the eccentricity cascade (EC). In this work, we analytically characterize the dynamics governing the EC and delineate the parameter space within which it effectively operates. Our qualitative results are as follows: (i) The proto-HJ's eccentricity is most efficiently excited when the inner triple is on the verge of dynamical instability, (ii) the addition of a distant fourth body allows this instability to be approached gradually, and (iii) the instability mechanism is closely related to the stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets in binaries. By deriving an analytic criterion for S-type instability, we obtain closed-form expressions describing the onset of the EC. Our results show that efficient HJ formation via the EC occurs across a broad range of intermediate perturbers, highlighting its potential as a robust migration channel.

TL;DR: 验证了TOI-6448 b，一个8.8±0.8地球半径的行星，轨道周期14.8天，年龄34±3百万年，填补了年轻行星样本的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解年轻（<50 Myr）近距离（<30天周期）行星的形成机制，并与开普勒发现的成熟行星分布进行统计比较。

Method: 确认TOI-6448恒星属于Vela Population IV星团，使用等时线、变星观测和陀螺年代学重新推导星团年龄。

Result: 发现TOI-6448 b行星位于参数空间中较少年老行星的区域，支持年轻恒星周围5-11地球半径行星过多的发现。

Conclusion: 年轻行星样本仍然不足，但TOI-6448 b的发现支持年轻恒星周围存在异常多的中等大小行星，未来搜索预计会发现更多<50 Myr的凌星行星。

Abstract: The discovery of infant (< 50 Myr), close-in (<30-day period) planets is vital in understanding the formation mechanisms that lead to the distribution of mature transiting planets as discovered by Kepler. Despite several discoveries in this age bin, the sample is still too small for a robust statistical comparison to older planets. Here we report the validation of TOI-6448 b, an 8.8 +/- 0.8 Re planet on a 14.8 day orbit. TOI-6448 was previously identified to be a likely member of Vela Population IV. We confirm the star's membership and re-derive the age of the cluster using isochrones, variability, and gyrochronology. We find the star, and thus planet, to be 34 +/- 3 Myr. Like other young planets, TOI-6448 b lands in a region of parameter space with few older planets. While just one data point, this fits with prior findings of an excess of 5-11Re planets around young stars far beyond what can be explained by reduced sensitivity at young ages. Our ongoing search of Vela, Taurus-Auriga, Sco-Cen, and Orion are expected to reveal dozens more < 50 Myr transiting planets.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究引力间接力对原行星盘-行星耦合的影响，包括密度扰动模式、行星施加在盘上的力矩以及盘施加在行星上的力矩的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恒星参考系中研究原行星盘与行星的引力耦合时，由于恒星反射运动导致非惯性系，会产生间接力。需要系统分析这些间接力对盘-行星耦合各方面的影响。

Method: 使用解析和数值方法，分析忽略间接力对密度扰动空间模式、行星力矩计算和行星迁移的影响，比较不同质量行星在有无间接力情况下的差异。

Result: 对于低质量行星，间接力主要影响m=1方位角谐波的扰动模式；对行星力矩和沉积力矩密度影响较小。对于高质量行星，更多方位角谐波受影响，间接力对行星力矩和II型迁移有更强影响。

Conclusion: 间接力对盘-行星耦合有重要影响，特别是在计算盘上力矩时需要考虑行星间接力以确保角动量守恒。间接力矩具有振荡性和径向发散特性。

Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.

### [4] [Hydrogen-line profiles from accreting gas giants and their CPDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10751)
*Gabriel-Dominique Marleau,Thomas Henning,Roy van Boekel,Myriam Benisty,Yuhiko Aoyama,Inga Kamp*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究使用ELT/METIS观测吸积中的气态巨行星的可行性，重点关注氢复合线（如Brackett alpha），以PDS 70 b为基准案例，分析线轮廓特征和观测时间需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前观测到的处于吸积阶段的气态巨行星很少，ELT仪器具有更高的灵敏度和更小的内工作角，能够进行详细表征。

Method: 结合半解析多维流描述和局部NLTE激波发射计算，生成高分辨率线轮廓，考虑无消光和忽略磁层吸积贡献的理想情况，使用解析光球模型和探测器灵敏度计算观测时间。

Result: PDS 70 b在最大吸积强度时，Br α线峰值等于光球连续谱，行星旋转使激波超量更明显。在4小时内Br α连续谱SNR=12，线峰值SNR=28，峰值超量仅需约10分钟达到SNR=3。

Conclusion: Br α是ELT/METIS在短积分时间内可用的有效行星形成示踪剂，解析线轮廓能为吸积行星的质量和半径提供独立约束，并帮助识别吸积机制。

Abstract: Few gas giants have been observed in their accretion phase. ELT instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, allowing detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph with a resolution R = 1e5. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible to METIS, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local NLTE shock-emission calculations. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction, appropriate for gas giants in gaps, and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion. We use resolved photospheric models, and include detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. When the accretion onto PDS 70 b is at its maximum observed strength, the Br a line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum, which is modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, making the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already only the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR = 12 in 4 h, and for the fiducial accretion rate, the line peak will have a per-bin SNR = 28 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 10 min to reach SNR = 3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to ELT/METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of accreting planets, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.

### [5] [Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782)
*Milagros Colazo,Alvaro Alvarez-Candal*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究结合多个巡天数据对海王星外天体进行光度测量，建立了包含43,878个测量值的大型数据库，分析了相位角对颜色的影响，并首次展示了鲁宾天文台的观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海王星外天体的颜色分布和相位效应研究不足，需要更大样本和相位校正来消除观测偏差，特别是暗弱红色天体的探测限制问题。

Method: 整合SDSS、Col-OSSOS、DES和鲁宾天文台首次观测数据，获得43,878个多波段测量值，计算12,852个绝对颜色测量和光谱斜率差异，进行统计分析。

Result: 颜色分布无明显双峰性或与轨道参数的相关性，证实相位角引起红化和蓝化趋势，鲁宾数据填补了参数空间的空白区域。

Conclusion: 相位校正在小相位角下也很重要，鲁宾天文台将极大扩展海王星外天体的发现和表征能力，颜色变化趋势与光谱平坦化一致。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects.
  From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.
  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.
  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.

### [6] [What's Inside Matters: The Effect of Oxygen Fugacity and Initial Volatile Abundance on the Atmospheres of the TRAPPIST-1 Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10801)
*Junellie Perez,Laura K. Schaefer,Edward Schwieterman,Kevin B. Stevenson,Howard Chen,Jacob Lustig-Yaeger*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了现有的大气-内部交换模型，加入了碳循环等地质过程，用于研究TRAPPIST-1行星的地质演化。模型追踪CO₂、CO、H₂O和H₂四种气体在四个行星储层中的分布，并应用于TRAPPIST-1 d、e和f行星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了有效识别TRAPPIST-1行星的大气组成，需要首先理解它们的地质演化过程，因此需要开发更完善的大气-内部交换模型。

Method: 扩展现有模型，加入碳循环、表面温度计算、氧逸度参数、氧化反应和扩散限制逃逸计算，追踪四种气体在四个行星储层中的分布。

Result: 氧逸度显著影响所有三个行星的H₂和CO₂分压，对两个行星的CO有轻微影响；H₂强烈依赖于水质量分数；大气过程的加入显著改变了H₂和CO的丰度。

Conclusion: 考虑内部参数对于进一步约束这些行星的地质演化至关重要，有助于将大气观测结果置于适当的背景下理解。

Abstract: The TRAPPIST-1 planets have become prime targets for studying the atmospheric and geophysical properties of planets around M-dwarf stars. To effectively identify their atmospheric composition, we first must understand their geological evolution. For this study, we focus on enhancing an existing atmosphere-interior exchange model by incorporating additional geological processes relevant to rocky planets. We have extended the model to include the carbon cycle, which enables the model to track four key gas species - CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, and H$_2$ - across four planetary reservoirs: the mantle, plate, ocean, and atmosphere. Major features added include surface temperature calculations which are crucial for the carbon cycle, oxygen fugacity as a planetary interior parameter in the model, and oxidation reactions and diffusion-limited escape calculations to the atmosphere portion of the model. We successfully validated the model for Earth and applied this model to study the effect of oxygen fugacity and initial water abundance on TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f. Our results for present-day abundances show that oxygen fugacity significantly affects the partial pressures of H$_2$ and CO$_2$ for all three planets with minor effects for CO on two of the planets. We also found that H$_2$ is strongly dependent on water mass fraction (WMF). The addition of atmospheric processes produced a significant difference in the H$_2$ and CO abundances at present-day. These results highlight the importance of considering interior parameters to be able to further constrain the geological evolution of these planets and effectively put atmosphere observations into context.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本研究利用ALMA高分辨率观测数据分析了HD 163296原行星盘化学组成，通过新检索代码DRive和化学模型PEGASIS约束了C/O比约为1.1，首次提供了NH2CHO和HNCO的严格上限限制，并揭示了DCO+的三环化学亚结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原行星盘的物理化学条件决定了其化学成分，这些成分随后被形成的行星继承。为了探测这些条件，需要高分辨率分子线观测和建模分析。

Method: 使用ALMA在波段3、4、6、7的高分辨率观测数据，结合新检索代码DRive分析分子柱密度和激发温度分布，利用PEGASIS天体化学代码模拟盘化学，并变化初始元素C/O比。

Result: 最佳拟合C/O比为1.1，与先前估计一致；提供了迄今最高分辨率的DCO+发射图，显示与尘埃连续环紧密对齐的三环化学亚结构；首次获得NH2CHO和HNCO的严格上限限制。

Conclusion: NH2CHO和HNCO主要在盘内颗粒表面形成，但物理化学解吸机制效率低，无法释放到可探测的气相丰度中，但仍是未来ALMA观测的有希望目标。

Abstract: The physical and chemical conditions within a protoplanetary disk play a crucial role in determining its chemical composition, which is subsequently inherited by any forming planets. To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at < 7e11 cm-2 and < 1e11 cm-2, respectively. Our chemical models suggest that NH2CHO and HNCO predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk. However, physico-chemical desorption mechanisms are inefficient at releasing these species into detectable gas-phase abundances, yet they remain promising targets for future ALMA observations.

Abstract: China is planing to launch the Tianwen-4 mission around the year 2030, with its aim being the exploration of Jupiter and its moon, Callisto. Within the realm of deep space exploration, the accuracy of ephemerides is of great importance. Current ephemerides employ a simplified rotation model for Callisto, which this study addresses by proposing a novel dynamical model. This model enhancesthe existing orbital dynamics by integrating Callisto's rotational motions influenced by gravitational torques from the Sun, Jupiter, and other Galilean moons within an inertial frame, capturing the intricate coupling between Callisto's orbital and rotational dynamics. The study establishes a full dynamical model by deriving analytical expressions for this coupling and developing an adjustment model for data fitting using precise orbit determination methods. Furthermore, the influence of tidal effects on Callisto's motion is investigated, considering its multi-layered internal structure. Results demonstrate that the difference between the newly established full model and the model in current ephemerides is on the order of tens of meters. When calculating the impact of different internal structures of Callisto on its orbit, the influence of three-layered and two-layered structures is on the order of meters, suggesting that the development of a high-precision dynamical model requires additional constraints on the internal structure of Callisto. This research provides a novel alternative for a new generation of precise numerical ephemerides for Callisto. Additionally, these findings provide a testing platform for the data from the Tianwen-4 mission.

TL;DR: 该研究通过N体模拟探讨了超级地球系统中轨道周期比分布的特征及其随时间演化的机制，发现共振链的不稳定性主要由外部行星胚胎的长期摄动引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释观测到的超级地球系统相邻行星轨道周期比分布特征及其时间演化，明确共振链不稳定的条件。

Method: 使用N体模拟跟踪100 Myr内超级地球的形成和轨道演化，从1 au处的行星胚胎环开始，分析行星在盘中的向内迁移和共振捕获过程。

Result: 模拟显示超级地球在盘中向内迁移并被邻近行星捕获到平均运动共振中，形成共振链。盘消散后部分共振链变得不稳定，最终轨道周期比分布与观测一致。

Conclusion: 共振链的不稳定性主要由外部轨道上残留胚胎的长期摄动触发，外部胚胎需要具有较大偏心率和特定质量、半长轴条件才能在约100 Myr时间尺度上激发内超级地球的偏心率。

Abstract: Recent observations have revealed the distribution of orbital period ratios of adjacent planets in multiple super-Earth systems and how these distributions change with time. The aim of this study is to clarify under what conditions the observed features of orbital period ratios of super-Earths can be explained, and to identify what causes the dynamical instability of super-Earths captured into resonant chains. We perform N-body simulations for 100 Myr that follow the formation and orbital evolution of super-Earths originating from a ring of planetary embryos at 1 au from the star. The simulations show that super-Earths undergo inward migration in the disk and are captured into mean-motion resonances with their neighbors. As a result, several resonant pairs form a resonant chain. After disk dispersal, some of these chains become dynamically unstable. In such cases, the final distribution of orbital period ratios and their time evolution can be consistent with recent observations. The instabilities of resonant chains are likely triggered by secular perturbations from embryos that remain on outer orbits beyond 1 au, indicating that not only giant planets but also small embryos can disrupt the resonances among inner super-Earths. We therefore further investigate the secular perturbations from outer embryos using analytic formulas and additional orbital calculations. We discuss the conditions required to excite the eccentricities of inner super-Earths on a timescale of about 100 Myr. These conditions include the need for large eccentricities of the outer embryos, as well as constraints on their masses and semimajor axes.

*Max Goldberg,Antoine C. Petit*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 行星形成模拟预测行星系统应处于轨道共振状态，但观测发现大多数系统是非共振的。研究表明，原始共振链在约1亿年内发生动力学不稳定性，导致系统脱离共振状态，这与观测数据一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行星形成模拟预测行星系统应处于轨道共振状态，但观测发现大多数系统是非共振的。需要解释这种理论与观测之间的差异，特别是考虑到新的观测显示共振比例随恒星年龄在约1亿年内急剧下降。

Method: 构建简化模型，包含I型迁移、胚胎生长和N体积分（持续到5亿年），生成合成行星群体。分析系统从共振状态缓慢扩散和动力学不稳定性的时间尺度。

Result: 几乎所有系统在盘阶段结束时都处于共振构型，但随后开始缓慢扩散。动力学不稳定性在数千万到数亿年内发生，特别是在具有汇聚迁移陷阱的盘中形成的系统中。不稳定性统计符合威布尔分布。

Conclusion: 模型系统与观测群体高度匹配，表明此类模型预测的高共振比例实际上与数据一致。之前报道的共振系统过剩是因为将早期演化模拟与成熟的Gyr年龄系统进行比较。盘耗散或其他早期机制触发的不稳定性不太可能与观测到的年轻系统一致。

Abstract: Planet formation simulations consistently predict compact systems of numerous small planets in chains of mean motion resonances formed by planet-disk interaction, but transiting planet surveys have found most systems to be non-resonant and somewhat dynamically excited. A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of ~100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.

*Shangjia Zhang,Zhaohuan Zhu,Callum W. Fairbairn*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究使用3D辐射流体动力学模拟分析了原行星盘中30度倾斜内盘投射的阴影效应，发现这种不对称阴影比极向对称阴影产生更强的吸积和盘翘曲，揭示了阴影是导致盘翘曲的原因而非结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然近红外和亚毫米观测中常见原行星盘阴影，且研究表明阴影会影响盘动力学，但之前只研究了中平面对称的情况（如极向对齐内盘）。本研究旨在探索30度相互倾斜内盘投射的不对称阴影效应。

Method: 使用3D辐射流体动力学模拟，研究30度相互倾斜内盘投射的阴影效应，并与极向情况对比。同时使用局部等温模拟验证热驱动机制，并通过傅里叶-埃尔米特分析识别驱动翘曲的温度扰动模式。

Result: 30度倾斜阴影导致比极向情况更强的吸积（α∼1），盘在方位角上被挤压两次产生激波和强径向流。外盘形成翘曲：内盘区域向阴影对齐，外盘以不同方向倾斜扭曲（相对内盘约32度）。m=1,n=1温度扰动模式驱动弯曲波产生翘曲。

Conclusion: 阴影会导致盘翘曲，而不仅仅是翘曲的结果。m=1,n=1温度扰动模式在3-30度相互倾斜范围内显著贡献，峰值在15度。研究为ALMA和NIR观测提供了可测试的预测。

Abstract: Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $α\sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.

Abstract: We present pkdgrav3, a high-performance, fully parallel tree-SPH code designed for large-scale hydrodynamic simulations including self-gravity. Building upon the long development history of pkdgrav, the code combines an efficient hierarchical tree algorithm for gravity and neighbor finding with a modern implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) optimized for massively parallel hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. Its hybrid shared/distributed memory model, combined with an asynchronous communication scheme, allows pkdgrav3 to scale efficiently to thousands of CPU cores and GPUs. We validate the numerical accuracy of pkdgrav3 using a suite of standard tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with analytic or reference solutions. The code was already used in several peer-reviewed publications to model planetary-scale impacts, where SPH's Lagrangian nature allows accurate tracking of material origin and thermodynamic evolution. These examples highlight pkdgrav3's robustness and efficiency in simulating highly dynamical, self-gravitating systems. pkdgrav3 thus provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable platform for astrophysical and planetary applications, capable of exploiting the full potential of modern heterogeneous high-performance computing systems.

TL;DR: 确认TOI-1422系统中存在第二颗凌星行星TOI-1422 c，这是一个亚海王星，轨道周期34.563天。该系统是一个罕见的反序系统，内行星密度低而外行星密度高。还检测到内行星的凌星时间变化，表明存在动力学相互作用，可能还有未探测到的第三颗行星。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究在径向速度数据中发现了周期约29天的残余信号，以及可能的单次凌星事件，但不确定这两个信号是否来自同一颗伴星。需要确认TOI-1422系统中是否存在第二颗行星。

Method: 结合TESS的三个凌星观测（包括两个新获得的扇区数据）以及新的和存档的径向速度测量数据，确认第二颗行星的存在。使用动力学分析结合凌星时间变化和径向速度数据来研究行星间的相互作用。

Result: 确认了第二颗凌星行星TOI-1422 c，半径为2.61±0.14地球半径，质量14±3地球质量，轨道周期34.563天。内行星TOI-1422 b密度为0.93 g/cm³，外行星密度为4.3 g/cm³，形成反序系统。检测到内行星的凌星时间变化，幅度达5小时。

Conclusion: TOI-1422是一个罕见的反序行星系统。动力学分析表明仅靠行星c无法完全解释观测到的凌星时间变化幅度，可能还存在第三颗未探测到的低质量行星位于两个已知轨道之间。

Abstract: TOI-1422 is a G2 V star ($V = 10.6$ mag) known to host a warm Neptune-sized planet, TOI-1422 b, with a mass and radius of about $9M_{\oplus}$ and $4R_{\oplus}$, on a circular orbit with a period of $12.997$ days. An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\pm0.14 R_{\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($ρ_{\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($ρ_{\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\rm c}=14\pm3 M_{\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.

TL;DR: 对HD 166191盘进行ALMA和SMA观测，未探测到SiO但检测到CO和尘埃连续谱发射，尘埃和气体都局限在20 au范围内，系统可能处于原行星盘向碎片盘过渡阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HD 166191盘中最近被认为发生类地行星带碰撞的现象，了解碰撞发生时盘的演化状态。

Method: 使用ALMA波段7和SMA进行非同时观测，检测尘埃连续谱和12CO J=3-2谱线，对CO和连续谱可见度进行建模分析。

Result: 未探测到SiO但检测到CO和尘埃发射，毫米波连续谱在2014-2024年间无变化，尘埃和气体都局限在20 au范围内，外盘区域可能富含气体。

Conclusion: HD 166191盘可能处于原行星盘或过渡/混合盘阶段，类地行星带碰撞可能发生在盘内几au气体耗尽的过渡时期，这对理解原行星盘向碎片盘转变及碰撞发生阶段具有重要意义。

Abstract: We present non-simultaneous ALMA band 7 and SMA observations of the HD 166191 disk, which was recently thought to have a collision in its terrestrial planet zone. Both observations detect dust continuum emission and the ALMA observations detect the 12CO J=3-2 line from the circumstellar disk. We do not detect SiO, a potential indicator of giant collisions, but place a limit on the total SiO mass in the system. Unlike previously observed in the infrared, we do not find evidence for variability at millimeter wavelengths when comparing the ALMA continuum observations from 2024 to the pre-collision SMA observations from 2014. We perform modeling of the CO and continuum visibilities and find that both the CO and dust are marginally spatially resolved and are contained to within 20 au from the central star. The modeling of the CO suggests that the outer regions of the disk are gas rich, although further observations are needed to confirm the total gas mass. The evolutionary state of this system has been debated in the literature, and our observations, while not definitive, are generally consistent with the idea that this disk is similar to an evolved protoplanetary or transition/hybrid disk. This could suggest that collisions in the terrestrial planet zone of HD 166191 are occurring while the disk is in a transitional phase, where the inner few au are depleted of gas. This makes HD 166191 an important object for understanding the transition between protoplanetary and debris disks and the stages at which collisions occur.
