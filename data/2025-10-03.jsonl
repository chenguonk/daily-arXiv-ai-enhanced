(2023). We demonstrate that the resulting final distribution of\nneighbouring planet period ratios contains only a small surviving fraction of\nresonant systems, in accordance with observations. The resulting planetary\narchitectures are largely in place by the end of the protoplanetary disk phase\n(within a few Myr), and do not require significant later dynamical evolution.\nThe divergence of planetary pairs during gas disk dispersal also leads to the\nexcitation of eccentricities when pairs cross mean motion resonances in a\ndivergent fashion. The resulting distribution of remnant free eccentricities is\nconsistent with the values inferred from the observation of transit durations\nand transit timing variations. We furthermore demonstrate that this conclusion\nis not significantly altered by tides, assuming standard values for tidal\ndissipation in Earth or Neptune-class planets. These results demonstrate that\nthe observed spacing and residual dynamical excitation of compact planetary\nsystems can be reproduced by migration through a protoplanetary disk, as long\nas the inner disk boundary is modelled as a gradual rollover, instead of a\nsharp transition. Such an effect can be achieved when the model accounts for\nthe diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk. The resulting\ndivergence of planetary pairs during the magnetospheric rebound phase breaks\nthe resonant chains, resulting in a better match to observations than disk\nmodels with more traditional inner boundaries."}

Combining our results with previous estimates, we find that the\nOH production rate of 12P/Pons-Brooks shows some fluctuations on timescales of\na few days, but gradually increases on longer timescales as the comet\napproaches the last perihelion. The water expansion velocities of the comet\nwere determined to be 1.55$\\pm$0.14 km s$^{-1}$, 1.55$\\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$, and\n2.02$^{+0.47}_{-0.45}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the observations on March 22nd, 27th and\n29th, respectively. The reason why the errors are different is because the\nsignal to noise ratio is different for each OH maser emission. All expansion\nvelocities are consistent with the individual results of the heuristic law\n(Tseng et al. 2007) within errors."}

The\ninferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield\nstrengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field\nmuch stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has\ndemonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently\namplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced\npressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock\nremanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter)\nformation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field\n(~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13\nuT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode.\nSuch magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude\nantipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo.\nFurthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter\nbasins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus)\ncould impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to\nthe overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma\namplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies\nand should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal\nanomaly measurements."}

They induce strong transit-timing variations with two incommensurate\nfrequencies. Previous photodynamical modeling of 3.3 years of transit and\nradial velocity data produced mass estimates of 32.4 +/- 1.7 M_E and 10.8 +/-\n0.6 M_E for planets b and c, respectively, and corresponding eccentricity\nestimates of 0.20 +/- 0.03 and 0.21 +/- 0.03. These high eccentricities raise\nquestions about the formation origin of the system, and this motivated us to\nextend the observing baseline in an attempt to better constrain their values.\nWe present a photodynamical analysis of 10 years of transit data that confirms\nthe previous mass estimates (30.8 +/- 1.3 M_E and 11.1 +/- 0.4 M_E), but\nreduces the median eccentricities to 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 0.07 +/- 0.02 for b and\nc, respectively. These values are more consistent with standard formation\nmodels, but still involve nonzero free eccentricity. The previously reported\nhigh eccentricities appear to be due to a single transit for which measurements\ntaken at twilight mimicked ingress. This resulted in a 12-minute error in the\nmidtransit time. The data that covered 1.3 and 5 so-called super and resonant\nperiods were used to match a Fourier analysis of the transit-timing variation\nsignal with simple analytic expressions for the frequencies and amplitudes to\nobtain planet mass estimates within 2% of the median photodynamical values,\nregardless of the eccentricities. Theoretical details of the analysis are\npresented in a companion paper. Additionally, we identified a possible planet\ncandidate situated exterior to the b-c pair.

Furthermore,\nMercury's ~3.9-3.7 billion-year old (Ga) crust is strongly magnetized (~10 nT\nat ~30-km altitude), indicating the presence of a past dynamo. However, the\nsource and strength of the field that magnetized this crust are unknown. To\naddress this, we performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nthe ancient solar wind interaction with the planetary field and coupled them\nwith thermal cooling and magnetization models. We show that the crustal\nmagnetization was likely produced by a surface field of at least ~2,000 nT,\nlikely >10,000 nT (i.e., ~10x or ~50-100x stronger than at present). Such\nstrong fields likely exclude both the solar wind feedback and thermoelectric\nmechanisms for driving the dynamo at 3.7 Ga ago.

In order to understand\nsulfur's journey from molecular clouds to planets, we need to understand the\nmolecular forms that sulfur takes in protoplanetary disks, where the rotational\nemission from sulfur-bearing molecules in the gas phase indicates a very low\nabundance. To address this question, we have updated the 2D time-dependent disk\nchemical modeling framework of Fogel et al.

We explore the effects of\ndifferent volatile (reactive) sulfur abundances, C/O ratios, initial sulfur\nmolecular forms, and cosmic-ray ionization rates. We find that a high C/O ratio\ncan explain both the prevalence of CS observed in disks and the lack of SO\ndetections, consistent with previous results. Additionally, initial sulfur form\ngreatly affects the ice abundances in the lower layers of the disk, which has\nimplications for comet formation and future observations with JWST."}

Their high inferred H/He mass\nfractions, required to explain their physical sizes, would lead to rapid\natmospheric escape, raising questions about their long-term retention. Recent\nmodeling work indicates that low-mass planets typically require 50\\% less H/He\nmass to match their observed radius, due to significant roles of the radiative\natmosphere and interior heating from the rock/iron core. Here, through a new\nquantitative analysis of XUV-driven escape in sub-Neptunes, we find that\nprevious studies overestimated mass loss, as scaling laws in low-gravity\nregimes deviate greatly from the widely used energy-limited regime. We define a\nnew regime, thermal-energy-mediated photoevaporation (TEMP), in which thermal\nenergy conversion critically sets the mass-loss rate. These effects make\nsuper-puffs more resilient to mass loss than previously thought. We develop a\ncoupled evolution model integrating this updated thermal evolution framework\nwith a 1D hydrodynamic photoevaporation model. Applying this novel, joint model\nto observed super-puffs and young low-density planets, we find that their\nmasses, radii and transit pressures align with predictions assuming either a\nclear or hazy atmosphere. This indicates that super-puffs have undergone a\ncombination of boil-off and photoevaporative mass loss, with boil-off\ndominating the process. Our results indicate that low-density planets typically\npossess both a thick convective envelope and substantial radiative atmosphere,\nwhich contribute to their large radii. For this to occur, these planets must\nhave intermediate masses of 5-10$M_\\oplus$ and receive stellar insolation\n$\\lesssim 30F_\\oplus$, favoring FG-type stars over M-dwarfs."}

Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying\ncarbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane\nabsorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric\nchemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct\nharmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands,\nproviding evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry.
