By analyzing various applications\nacross domains such as astronomical research, space exploration, space resource\nutilizations, national defense, and space communication, this study identifies\nkey areas where Lagrange points offer significant advantages. The research\nemploys a qualitative analysis of existing literature combined with theoretical\nmodeling to demonstrate how these points can be optimally utilized in future\nspace missions. The finding suggests that a Systems Theory approach not only\nclarifies the roles and benefits of Lagrange points in space mission design but\nalso reveals new pathways for enhancing mission efficiency and effectiveness.\nThis thesis underscores the importance of a holistic view in the strategic\nplanning of space missions and provides a foundational approach for integrating\nLagrange points into future exploratory and operational frameworks."}

Comments welcome at sukrit@arizona.edu", "summary": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to spectrally characterize\nsmall exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars, but interpretation of these spectra is\nambiguous, with stellar, instrumental, or atmospheric origins possible for\napparent spectral features. Consequently, interpretation of JWST small\nexoplanet spectra follows a Bayesian approach, with less theoretically\nplausible interpretations facing a higher burden of proof. Here, we use\nphotochemical modeling to evaluate the plausibility of warm exo-Titans,\nexoplanets with N$_2$-CH$_4$ atmospheres analogous to Titan but orbiting closer\nto their host stars. Consideration of warm exo-Titans is motivated by arguments\nfrom planet formation, as well as tentative evidence from observations. Using\nTRAPPIST-1e as a case study, we show that the higher instellation experienced\nby warm exo-Titans reduces their CH$_4$ lifetime $\\tau_{\\text{CH}_{4}}$\nrelative to true Titan by orders of magnitude, reducing the probability of\nobserving them. We constrain the $\\tau_{\\text{CH}_{4}}$ on a warm exo-Titan to\nbe $\\leq0.1\\times$ (and most likely $\\leq0.02\\times$) true Titan, implying the\nabsolute probability of detecting a warm exo-Titan is $<0.1$ and likely\n$<0.01$. This finding is consistent with recent JWST nondetections of\nCH$_4$-dominated atmospheres on warm terrestrial exoplanets. The low prior\nprobability means that the standard of proof required to claim a warm exo-Titan\ndetection is high, and we offer specific suggestions towards such a standard of\nproof. Observation of oxidized carbon species would corroborate a putative warm\nexo-Titan detection. Confirmed detection of warm exo-Titans would signal the\nneed to fundamentally rethink our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and\nphotochemistry of Titan-like worlds."}

Demographic studies also require a detailed\nunderstanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet\npopulations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered\nunsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a\npublicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after\nthe Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of\npromising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic\nstudies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against\nnoise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter\nachieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic\nfalse alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and\nreducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet\ncandidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical\nto perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational\nlimitations.

We\ndemonstrate through ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte\nCarlo (KMC) simulations that silicate dust sublimation is inherently a\nnon-equilibrium kinetic process. The binding energies and vibrational\nfrequencies governing desorption, calculated for MgSiO3 and other compositions,\nreveal that sublimation timescales far exceed local dynamical times, allowing\ngrains to persist in a superheated state. This kinetic inhibition results in a\nbroad, dynamic sublimation front whose location and morphology are strongly\nregulated by radial advection and dust coagulation. Our coupled simulations,\nintegrating sublimation with advection and grain evolution, show that the front\nvaries radially by a factor of four with accretion rate and exhibits a\nvertically stratified, bowl-shaped structure. These findings imply that the\ninner disk dust distribution, thermal structure, and subsequent planet\nformation are profoundly influenced by the kinematics and kinetics of dust\ngrains, necessitating a departure from equilibrium prescriptions in disk models\nand interpretations of inner rim observations."}

The global circulation, generating downwellings on the\nfarside and a deeper return flow on the nearside, results that magmas flow from\nthe nearside to the farside in the shallow magma ocean while the the direction\nof flow is opposite in the deep magma ocean. Such flow in the shallow magma\nocean would transport anorthositic crystals formed in the nearside to the\nfarside.

The surface slopes were analyzed\nto predict possible regions of particle motion and accumulation. The results\nshow that most regions of the comet's surface have low slopes. Furthermore, we\nanalyzed the slopes under the effects of Third-Body gravitational and Solar\nRadiation Pressure perturbations. Our results showed that the effects of\nThird-Body perturbations do not significantly affect the global behavior of\nslopes.

This\nprocess starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass\nof the core.

Using the GAS\ngianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure\nmodels on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to\nderive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three\ndifferent retrievals assuming low (-2.0 < log(Fe/H) < 0.5), medium ( 0.5 <\nlog(Fe/H) < 1.4), and high (1.4 < log(Fe/H) < 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The\ndistribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of\nplanet formation models.

Additionally, we\nfind a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is\nlocated at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric\nmetallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the\n$f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with\nassumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when\n$M_{env} \\approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \\sim 0.5$).
