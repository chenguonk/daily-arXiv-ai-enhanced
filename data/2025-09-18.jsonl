Modeling and analysis of a decade-long catalog of Earthshine observations", "comment": "Accepted for publication on A&A", "summary": "Earthshine observations offer a unique opportunity to study Earth as an\nexoplanet seen from the Moon. As the Sun-Earth-Moon geometry changes, Earth can\nbe observed as a spatially unresolved exoplanet at different phase angles,\nproviding important context for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets.\nHere, we present a catalog of Earthshine polarization spectra obtained with\nFORS2 on the VLT, covering diverse scenes, surface conditions, cloud\nproperties, and weather patterns for over a decade. For the first time, we\nmodel this extensive dataset in detail using a homogeneous modeling framework.\nPrevious efforts to model some of these spectra struggled to reproduce the\nobserved polarization continuum, even with advanced 3D radiative transfer\nmodels incorporating satellite-derived surface and atmospheric data. We improve\nupon this with a 3D model that includes subgrid cloud variability,\nwavelength-dependent surface albedo maps, and an accurate treatment of ocean\nglint. Our simulations successfully reproduce most observed spectra to a much\nhigher precision than previously possible. Our statistical analysis reveals\nthat the spectral slope in the visible can distinguish between ocean and mixed\nsurfaces in both reflected and polarized light, which is not possible using\nbroadband filters alone. Polarized light at large phase angles, beyond the\nRayleigh scattering regime, is particularly effective in differentiating oceans\nfrom land, unlike reflected light. We also identify correlations between cloud\noptical thickness and the polarized spectral slope, and between cloud cover and\nbroadband B-R differences in reflected light, demonstrating the diagnostic\npower of these observations. This work highlight the potential of polarization\nfor characterizing Earth-like exoplanets. From polarization alone, we can infer\noceans, vegetation, and an active water cycle, key indicators of a habitable\nplanet."}
