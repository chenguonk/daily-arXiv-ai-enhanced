TL;DR: 研究探讨了行星系统和木星、土星、天王星卫星系统中主要规则卫星距离的近似几何级数特征，分析了主星潮汐和气体阻力对轨道距离比的影响，发现这些系统的平均距离比在太阳系年龄时间尺度下基本保持不变。

Motivation: 行星系统和卫星系统中主要规则卫星距离呈现近似几何级数分布，这一特征常被忽视。研究旨在探究主星潮汐和原始星云气体阻力这两种非直接引力相互作用对卫星轨道距离比的影响，以理解这些系统距离分布的演化规律。

Method: 首先推导了估算过去初始平均距离比的通用关系式，并针对主星潮汐和原始星云气体阻力进行了特征化分析。然后评估了这两种效应对四个系统（行星系统、木星、土星、天王星卫星系统）平均距离比的影响。

Result: 1) 在太阳系年龄时间尺度下，主星潮汐作用未显著改变四个系统的平均距离比；2) 初始星云消散后，平均距离比基本保持不变；3) 原始星云气体阻力对平均距离比的影响有限，取决于初始星云模型和有效阻力作用时间。

Conclusion: 行星系统和卫星系统的平均距离比在演化过程中基本保持稳定，卫星间的轨道共振会进一步加强这种近似守恒。但这一结论仅适用于系统平均距离比，不意味着单个卫星距离或个体距离比也保持不变。

Abstract: The near geometrical progressions of distances of main regular secondaries in the planetary system and in the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus are often disregarded, contrary to other regular orbital features. Among dynamical effects other than direct gravitational interactions, primary tides and gas drag cause the secondary's semi-major axis to evolve secularly. The consequences of these two effects on the mean ratios of secondary orbital distances are assessed for the four systems. A general relation is first derived to estimate a past initial mean distance ratio and is characterised for primary tides and for the drag caused by primordial nebulae. Results show first that the mean distance ratios of the four systems did not evolve sensibly under primary tidal action for periods corresponding to the age of the Solar System, and that the mean distance ratios are approximately conserved after the dissipation of initial nebulae. Secondly, the mean distance ratios may not have changed much due to gas drag caused by primaeval nebulae after formation of initial proto-secondaries and for periods corresponding to assumed lifetimes of nebulae, depending on initial nebulae models and on periods of effective drag. These results involve only the systems' mean distance ratios and do not imply that neither the secondary distances nor the individual distance ratios are conserved. Resonances among secondaries mean motions would reinforce the approximate conservation of mean distance ratios.

TL;DR: 对WD 0106-328白矮星25年光谱观测发现MgII和CaII谱线等值宽度显著变化，Mg和Ca吸积率分别下降约20%和60%，首次实证验证了白矮星扩散理论，但持续存在的大气金属表明存在更缓慢的星周过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究白矮星WD 0106-328中金属丰度的变化，以验证白矮星扩散理论预测，并理解尘埃污染白矮星中金属持续存在的机制。

Method: 使用VLT和Keck望远镜在25年间进行6个时期的光谱观测，分析MgII和CaII谱线等值宽度的变化；结合哈勃太空望远镜的光学和紫外光谱数据，检测主要岩石形成元素（O、Mg、Si、Fe）。

Result: MgII和CaII谱线等值宽度发生统计显著变化，两者比值也可能变化（恒定概率仅7%）；2000-2025年间Mg和Ca吸积率分别下降约20%和60%；Fe在吸积物质中质量占主导，且主要以纯金属形式从分化的母体内部输送。

Conclusion: 金属丰度下降首次实证验证了白矮星扩散理论（预测沉降时间尺度为天量级），但大气金属持续存在需要更缓慢的星周过程（如电离金属盘中的粘性扩散）；化学分异吸积可能是行星组装、碎片化、盘演化共同作用的结果。

Abstract: This letter reports statistically significant changes in the equivalent widths of MgII and CaII lines in the dusty and polluted white dwarf WD 0106-328, based on six epochs of spectroscopy using the VLT and Keck spanning 25 yr. Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $α\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales.

TL;DR: LSST能发现79.7%的大型撞击体(>140m)，但对中小型撞击体发现率显著下降，且预警时间随尺寸减小而缩短，需要多巡天策略协同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LSST巡天对潜在撞击小行星的发现能力，分析其在不同尺寸撞击体上的性能局限，为行星防御提供数据支持

Method: 通过微扰NEOMOD3轨道生成合成撞击体种群，使用Sorcha巡天模拟器评估LSST发现效率，分析不同尺寸撞击体的发现率和预警时间

Result: LSST对大型撞击体(>140m)发现率79.7%，但对中小型(10-20m)仅10.5%；预警时间从大型的数月到小型的仅数周；发现限制因素随尺寸变化

Conclusion: LSST虽能发现暗弱小型撞击体，但无法单独保证全尺寸谱系的长期预警，需要Argus Array等高频率浅深度巡天协同工作

Abstract: Asteroid impactors larger than ~10 m, from Chelyabinsk-scale airburst and Tunguska-scale events to >300 m continental threats, remain the dominant planetary-defense risk. While the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will transform Solar System science, its observing cadence and survey design were not specifically optimized to discover imminent impactors. To assess its performance, we introduce a new method for efficiently generating synthetic impactor populations by minimally perturbing sampled NEOMOD3 orbits and evaluate their discovery efficiency with the Sorcha survey simulator. Our simulations show that LSST discovers 79.7% of large impactors (>140 m), decreasing to 50.3% for upper mid-sized (50-140 m), 26.8% for lower mid-sized (20 - 50 m), and 10.5% for small objects (10-20 m). Warning times of the discovered impactors show a similar size dependence: small objects are typically discovered only weeks before impact (median:12.4 days), lower mid-sized within a month (median: 21.5 days), and upper mid-sized objects on timescales of a few months (median: 106.2 days). 39.0% of large impactors are discovered more than a year before impact, lacking long-lead warning despite their brightness. A loss-mode analysis reveals the underlying cause that small impactors are limited mainly by photometric sensitivity, whereas mid-sized and large objects are missed primarily due to cadence and linking constraints from LSST and its Solar System Processing (SSP) Pipelines. These results show that LSST excels at discovering faint, small impactors, but cannot by itself guarantee long-lead warning across the hazardous size spectrum. Coordinated multi-survey strategies will therefore be essential in the LSST era to achieve robust planetary-defense capability, and we study a complementary high-cadence, shallow-depth example with the Argus Array.

TL;DR: 发现并表征了TOI-6692 b，一颗轨道周期130天、偏心率约0.54的偏心木星，是少数具有可靠质量、半径和偏心率测量的长周期行星之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究长周期（>100天）系外行星的轨道特性，特别是偏心率分布，以了解行星形成和演化机制，如高偏心率潮汐迁移与行星-行星散射过程的差异。

Method: 通过TESS巡天发现单次凌星候选体，利用麦哲伦望远镜的PFS光谱仪进行径向速度监测确认周期，补充CHIRON、FEROS和CORALIE光谱仪数据，结合LCOGT地基光度观测进行凌星监测和周期精化。

Result: 确认TOI-6692 b为轨道周期130天、偏心率0.54的木星质量行星，其偏心率低于高偏心率潮汐迁移预期，更符合行星-行星散射模型；检测到长期径向速度趋势，表明存在外伴星。

Conclusion: TOI-6692 b为研究长周期巨行星轨道演化提供了重要案例，展示了地基光度设施在凌星监测方面的能力，即使存在较大星历表不确定性也能通过定时观测确认周期。

Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-6692 b, an eccentric (e~0.54) Jupiter on a 130-day orbit. TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today.

TL;DR: Mercury-Arχes是一个高性能并行n体代码，用于模拟行星形成过程，包括行星生长、迁移、与盘气体的相互作用以及星子撞击通量。

Motivation: 行星形成涉及大量引力相互作用的天体，且都嵌入在原生原行星盘气体中，这些因素使得现实的行星形成模拟计算需求极高，需要高性能方法来准确建模行星系统的形成。

Result: Mercury-Arχes已成功应用于多个系外行星和太阳系研究，能够模拟行星形成过程中的生长、迁移、与盘气体相互作用以及星子撞击通量演化。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了Mercury-Arχes物理建模能力的最新概述，并首次详细描述了其基于OpenMP的高性能实现，为行星形成研究提供了强大的计算工具。

Abstract: Forming planetary systems are populated by large numbers of gravitationally interacting planetary bodies, spanning from massive giant planets to small planetesimals akin to present-day asteroids and comets. All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$χ$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$χ$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process. In this work we provide the up-to-date overview of its physical modeling capabilities and the first detailed description of its high-performance implementation based on the OpenMP directive-based parallelism for shared memory environments, to harness the multi-thread and vectorization features of modern processor architectures.

Conclusion: 需要高性能计算支持的跨学科建模研究来正确探索这类高维度问题，以理解行星大气成分多样性的形成机制

Abstract: The growing body of atmospheric observations of exoplanets from space and ground-based facilities showcases how the great diversity of the planetary population is not limited to their physical properties but extends to their compositions. The ESA space mission Ariel will observe and characterise hundreds of exoplanetary atmospheres to explore and understand the roots of this compositional diversity. To lay the foundations for the Ariel mission, the OPAL Key Science Project is tasked with creating an unprecedented library of realistic synthetic atmospheres spanning tens of elements and hundreds of molecules on which the Ariel consortium will test and validate its codes and pipelines ahead of launch. In this work we describe the aims and the pipeline of codes of the OPAL project, as well as the process through which we trace the genetic link connecting planets to their native protoplanetary disks and host stars. We present the early results of this complex and unprecedented endeavour and discuss how they highlight the great diversity of outcomes that emerge from the large degeneracy in the parameter space of possible initial conditions to the planet formation process. This, in turn, illustrates the growing importance of interdisciplinary modelling studies supported by high-performance computing methods and infrastructures to properly investigate this class of high-dimensionality problems.

TL;DR: 对星际天体3I/ATLAS进行后近日点光谱观测，确认其彗星活动特征，测量了多种分子和金属元素的产生率及径向分布，发现与太阳系彗星相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过研究星际天体的彗星活动，可以直接探测其他恒星系统的环境特征。3I/ATLAS作为新发现的星际天体，其前后近日点的观测对比有助于理解星际彗星的性质。

Method: 使用凯克宇宙网成像仪（Keck Cosmic Web Imager）在2025年11月16日对3I/ATLAS进行后近日点蓝色敏感积分视场单元光谱观测。

Result: 确认了CN、Fe、Ni的释放，并首次检测到碳链分子C2和C3。测得Fe和Ni的产生率分别为(9.55±3.96)×10²⁵和(6.61±2.74)×10²⁵ atoms/s，其比值为-0.16±0.03，与太阳系彗星一致。测得各物种的特征e折叠半径：Ni 3880±39 km，CN 6053±68 km，C2 4194±45 km，C3 3833±45 km，比前近日点测量值增加了约6.5-7倍。

Conclusion: 3I/ATLAS在后近日点阶段仍表现出与太阳系彗星基本一致的彗星行为特征，支持星际彗星与太阳系彗星具有相似性质的假设。

Abstract: The environs of other stellar systems may be directly probed by analyzing the cometary activity of interstellar objects. The recently discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was the subject of an intensive worldwide follow-up campaign in its pre-perihelion approach. Now, 3I/ATLAS has begun its post-perihelion departure from the Solar System. In this letter, we report the first post-perihelion blue-sensitive integral-field unit spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager on November 16, 2025. We confirm previously reported CN, Fe, and Ni outgassing along with detections of carbon chain molecules $\mathrm{C}_2$ and $\mathrm{C}_3$. We calculate production rates for each species. We find Fe and Ni production rates of $\mathrm{Q_{Fe}} = (9.55\pm3.96)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and $\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} = (6.61\pm2.74)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, resulting in a ratio of $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}}) = -0.16\pm0.03$, which matches Solar System comets well and continues the pre-perihelion trend of declining $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}})$ with $r_h$. We investigate the radial distributions of these elemental species and find characteristic $e$-folding radii of 3880$\pm$39 km for Ni, 6053$\pm$68 km for CN, 4194$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_2$, and 3833$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_3$. Compared to pre-perihelion measurements, these radii have increased by a factor of $\sim$6.5--7. Our post-perihelion observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS continues to exhibit cometary behavior broadly consistent with Solar System comets.
