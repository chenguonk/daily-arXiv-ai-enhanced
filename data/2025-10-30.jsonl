These\ndiscs may have any slowly varying surface density or temperature profile. For\nspecific 'self-similar' disc profiles, solutions to our equation match (novel)\nsmooth non-linear exact spiral solutions derived via a separate method, which\nhighlight that non-linear spiral waves need not shock. Indeed, at low\namplitudes, we find that dispersion can overcome wave steepening, and may\nprevent the inner spiral wakes excited by low mass planets (below roughly 1% of\na thermal mass) embedded in protoplanetary discs from shocking. At high\namplitudes, we find a simple universal description of non-linear spiral waves\nwith shocks, as well as caps on the possible amplitude and wave action flux of\nnon-linear spirals both with and without shocks, depending on how many arms\nthey have. We further find that highly non-linear spirals are far more loosely\nwound than their linear counterparts. These developments shed light on why\ntwo-armed spirals are prevalent across a range of astrophysical systems which\ndon't necessarily possess an intrinsic twofold symmetry, and why they appear\nsurprisingly loosely wound in observations. These results are supported by very\nhigh-resolution numerical simulations."}

However, the probability that a rocky planet\nmay exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple\nfactors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior\ncomposition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior\ncomposition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be\nimpacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first\nexploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet\nradius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky\nplanets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and\nGALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content)\nsignificantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for\nsurface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1\nM$_\\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may\nreduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on\nseafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be\nflooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like\ntopographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form\nhigh-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering. Thus, for the first time, we\nshow that the composition and topography of the mantle influence the water\ninventory of rocky planets."}

The structure of the\ncavity is determined by the complex interplay between spirals induced by tidal\nforcing from the binary and the viscous and radiative damping of the spirals at\nthe cavity edge. To fully understand what determines the properties of observed\ncavities, it is therefore necessary to capture the effect of radiative\nprocesses in modelling. To this end, we run 27 simulations of circumbinary\ndiscs in 2D using the PLUTO code. These simulations include various size\nscales, binary eccentricities and thermodynamic models. We find that the\ndiverse cavity shapes are a natural outcome of the radially-varying cooling\ntimescale, as different radiative processes mediate cooling at different disc\nsize regimes. For binaries with separation of a few au, where the cooling\ntimescale is comparable to the orbital timescale at the cavity edge, we recover\nmuch more circular cavities than for quickly- or slowly-cooling discs. Our\nresults show that the cavity structure around several binary systems such as Cs\nCha and GG Tau can be explained with one physical model, and highlight the\nimportance of radiative cooling in modelling the dynamical evolution of\ncircumbinary discs."}

Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets\norbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the\nrecent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current\nlimitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the\nhost star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time\nobservations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over\n350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial\nvelocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength\ndependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength\nindependent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of\nthe measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the\ndependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity\nindices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph\nand each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective\nturnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M\ndwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\\% of GTO stars show a\nstrong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the\nmeasured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV\npredicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with\nmoderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable\nactivity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We\nconclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar\nactivity and the search for low mass rocky planets."}

This is an instability of laminar flows\n(``Poincar\\'{e} flows\") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate,\nspin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in\nconvective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincar\\'{e} number\"\n$\\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the\nprecessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using\nCartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study\nits interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating\nRayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection. The precessional instability without convection\nresults in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high\nvalues of $\\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as\n$\\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With\nconvection, the Poincar\\'e number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to\nlower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on\nlarge-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous\ntidal dissipation (scaling as $\\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses\ntidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities\nobtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating)\nmixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of\nHot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more\nefficient than the effective viscosity of convection.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating\nthe amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the\nsimplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the\ntidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between\nthe known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the\nAM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red\ngiants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to\nprovide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit\nof the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses\nand an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already\nrapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the\nobliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin\nstructure of Kepler-56.
