We answer this question by analyzing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction. The steady state eccentricity of the outer disk (outside of the planet's orbit) is described as a balance between eccentricity excitation by the 1:3 eccentric Lindblad resonance and eccentricity damping by gas pressure. This eccentricity scales with $q(\\frac{h_p}{r_p})^{(-1)}(\\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p})^{(a-\\frac{b}{2}-2)}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, $\\frac{h_p}{r_p}$ is the disk aspect ratio, $\\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p}$ is the radial position of the outer gap edge divided by the planet's position, and $a$ and $b$ are the negative exponents in the disk's surface density and temperature power law profiles, respectively. We derive a semi-analytic eccentricity profile that agrees with numerical simulations to within 30%. Our result is a first step to quantitatively interpret observations of eccentric protoplanetary disks, such as MWC 758, HD 142527, IRS 48, and CI Tau."}

Owen"], "title": "Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs", "comment": "13 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ and $\\dot{M}_{\\rm pe}$ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations."}

In extreme cases, it is hypothesized that the mass loss can be high enough for the escaping planetary material to wrap around the star, forming a long-lasting circumstellar torus. In this work, we develop a physical model of such circumstellar tori and use a ray tracing scheme to calculate the attenuation of stellar light passing through them. We show that the presence of a circumstellar torus significantly increases the equivalent width of the observed stellar He I 10830~Å~line. When combined with observations of the star's Ca II H & K lines, these systems can typically be distinguished from field stars. Based on these results, we propose a survey of stars hosting close-in planets, combining observations of the He I 10830~Å~and Ca II H & K lines to search for circumstellar tori generated from planetary mass-loss in these systems."}

We searched for such recent signatures using orbit-similarity statistics and explicit null-hypothesis testing applied to shower-removed, asteroidal video-meteor datasets. Our sample comprises 235{,}271 meteors and fireballs from four all-sky video networks (GMN, CAMS, EDMOND, and SonotaCo). For meteors we use the geocentric dissimilarity criterion $D_N$ and construct KDE-based sporadic null realizations to evaluate (i) global cumulative similarity distributions and (ii) localized $D_N$-conditioned ($D_N<0.015$) pair-excess maps in the $(U,λ_\\odot)$ plane; we additionally apply DBSCAN ($ε=0.03$, $\\mathrm{min\\_samples}=2$) to isolate the coherent, statistically significant structures. We find no survey-consistent, stream-like signature in the Earth-like, low-inclination region expected for a distinct \\emph{recent} tidal-disruption family; instead, significant-bin membership implies, under our adopted detection thresholds and binning, a conservative combined upper limit of $\\leq 53/235{,}271$ ($\\leq 2.3\\times10^{-4}$) for sporadic asteroidal meteors plausibly attributable to a detectable recent tidal-disruption-like contribution.

The analysis of 67 simulated systems revealed key insights: (1) All systems featured the primary trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: cold/hot classical, resonant, scattered, and detached; (2) Captures into stable resonant orbits favored close Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs; e.g., 3:2, 2:1), while distant ones beyond 50 au (e.g., 5:2 MMR) were underpopulated; (3) Optimal matches to observed resonant fractions and the classical region (including the kernel) arose from models considering a jumping Neptune, self-gravitating Plutos, and an initial disk edge at 45-47 au; (4) Models including primordial scattered disks boosted distant MMR captures but overproduced scattered objects; (5) All models were inefficient at producing the detached (q > 40 au) and high-i (i > 45 deg) populations and failed to populate observed niches, such as distant detached (a > 245 au), low-i detached (i < 20 deg), low-i scattered with q = 37-40 au (i < 20 deg), and extreme (q > 50 au or i > 50 deg) TNOs; (6) Grainy migration effects peaked early, fading as the Plutos were removed; (7) With a few primordial Plutos surviving inside 50 au, the initial population was estimated at ~150-500 to explain Pluto's solitary status. Although our four-giant-planet models reasonably replicate the trans-Neptunian structure within 50 au, they fail to account for detached, high-i, and extreme TNOs. Additional processes (e.g., a distant undiscovered planet) are required for a comprehensive outer solar system framework."}

To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times (~0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after ~0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building."}

Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (>20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data."}

These molecules have been detected on a variety of celestial bodies, including icy moons, and may play a crucial role in shaping the current composition of the Galilean moons. Experimental studies suggest that their formation could result from UV irradiation or thermal processing of NH3:CO2 ices. In this context, we investigate the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula and their subsequent transport to the Jupiter system region. Lagrangian transport and irradiation simulations of 500 individual particles are performed using a two-dimensional disk evolution model. Based on experiments with UV irradiation and thermal processing of CO2:NH3 ice, this model allows us to estimate the estimate the potential for the formation of complex organic molecules through these processes. Almost none of the particles released at a local temperature of 20 K (corresponding to ~12 AU from the Sun) reach the location of the system of Jupiter. However, when released at a local temperature of 80 K (~7 AU), approximately 45% of the centimetric particles and 30% of the micrometric particles can form complex organic molecules via thermal processing, subsequently reaching the location of the system of Jupiter within 300 kyr. Assuming that the Galilean moons formed in a cold circumplanetary disk around Jupiter, the nitrogen-bearing species potentially present in their interiors could have originated from the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula."}

These include a nitrogen atmosphere with a condensible gas - methane - replacing the Earth's water, leading to an active meteorology with rainfall and surface manifestations including rivers, lakes and seas, and the dissolution of karstic terrain. Other phenomena such as craters, dunes, and tectonic features are found elsewhere - e.g. on Mars and Venus - but their continuing alteration by pluvial, fluvial and lacustrine processes can be studied only on Earth and Titan. Meanwhile Titan also hosts an interior liquid water ocean with similarities to the Earth as well as to ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Our focus in this review paper is twofold: to describe the geophysical and geological parallels between Earth and Titan, and to evaluate the yet-underexploited possibilities for field analog research to gain new knowledge about these processes. To date, Titan's much colder temperature and different atmospheric and crustal materials have led to a skepticism that useful analogs can be found on Earth. Our conclusion, however, is that a much larger range of useful analog field work is possible and this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of both worlds. Such investigation will supplement the existing sparse data for Titan returned by space missions, will greatly enhance our understanding of such datasets, and will help to provide science impetus and goals for future missions."}

The highly unusual trait of the comet that has so far been ascertained is its extraordinarily long orbital period. The most recent orbital computations make it increasingly likely that the object is a fragment of one of the comets observed by Ammianus Marcellinus in AD 363, thereby strengthening evidence in support of the contact-binary hypothesis of the Kreutz system. In this context, the comet is the only second-generation fragment of Aristotle's comet that we are aware of to appear after the 12th century. It does not look like a major fragment, but rather like an outlying fragment of a much larger sungrazer. In 363 it apparently separated from a parent different from the lineage of comet Pereyra. The light curve of comet MAPS has so far been fairly smooth, without outbursts. To reach the brightness of comet Ikeya-Seki, the comet would have to follow an r^(-17) law in the coming weeks, which is unlikely."}
