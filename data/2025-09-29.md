### [1] [Upper Limit on the Non-Gravitational Acceleration and Lower Limits on the Nucleus Mass and Diameter of 3I/ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21408)
*Richard Cloete,Abraham Loeb,Peter Vereš*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 基于3I/ATLAS彗星的天体测量数据，该研究推导出非引力加速度的上限，并基于JWST数据估计了彗星的最小质量和直径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究3I/ATLAS彗星的非引力效应，以了解其物理特性，包括质量和尺寸。

Method: 使用小行星中心提供的3I/ATLAS彗星天体测量数据（2025年5月15日至9月23日），分析其与最佳拟合重力轨迹的偏差，并结合JWST数据推断质量损失率和流出速度。

Result: 非引力加速度小于约3×10⁻¹⁰ au/d²；彗星的最小质量为3.3×10¹⁶克，最小直径为5公里。

Conclusion: 3I/ATLAS彗星的非引力加速度非常小，其质量和直径的下限分别为3.3×10¹⁶克和5公里。

Abstract: We use astrometric data on 3I/ATLAS compiled by the Minor Planet Center from
May 15 to September 23, 2025, and derive an upper limit on any statistically
significant deviation from the best-fit gravity-based trajectory. The residuals
imply that the non-gravitational acceleration is smaller than $\sim 3 \times
10^{-10}\,{\rm au\,d^{-2}}$. Based on the total mass-loss rate and outflow
speed inferred from JWST data on August 6, 2025, we derive lower limits on the
mass and diameter of 3I/ATLAS of $3.3 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ and $5\,{\rm
km}$, respectively.

### [2] [The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21430)
*Valentin Skoutnev,Aurélie Astoul,Adrian J. Barker*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文研究了旋转流体中有限振幅惯性波的线性稳定性和非线性破裂机制，发现最不稳定扰动的波数方向主要取决于波频率，而波能量会通过前向级联耗散或积累为长寿命的地转模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 惯性波在旋转流体中传输能量和动量，对地球海洋、气态行星和恒星内部的混合和潮汐耗散有重要贡献，但其稳定性和破裂机制尚未完全理解。

Method: 使用Floquet理论和直接数值模拟分析有限振幅传播平面惯性波的线性稳定性和非线性破裂过程。Floquet分析适用于任意扰动波长和主波振幅。

Result: 发现最不稳定扰动的波长在低波幅时相对于主波波长较小，在高波幅时变得相当；地转模态的转换效率随波幅增加而增加，随主波频率减小而增加。

Conclusion: 这些结果为理解惯性波在旋转湍流中的作用、惯性波束的传输特性以及在更复杂环境中的传播提供了基础。

Abstract: Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a
major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous
planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown
mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and
nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using
Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis
generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation
wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber
orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave
frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations
have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low
wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use
direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and
examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or
accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the
conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave
amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant
triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases
with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient
coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability
and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for
understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport
properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more
complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.

### [3] [Formation of multiple dynamical classes in the Kuiper belt via disk dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21437)
*Tommy Chi Ho Lau,Til Birnstiel,Sebastian Markus Stammler,Joanna Drążkowska*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个综合的太阳系外区形成模型，将尘埃漂移、凝聚、星子形成、N体引力、卵石吸积、行星迁移、核心吸积、间隙形成和内部光蒸发等过程整合在一个框架中，解释了多种类型星子的形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究太阳系外区（如柯伊伯带）和系外柯伊伯带中小行星体的形成机制，为行星形成模型提供关键约束，特别是解释冷经典柯伊伯带天体作为流不稳定性的直接产物。

Method: 开发了一个综合建模框架，整合了尘埃漂移与凝聚、星子形成、N体引力、卵石吸积、行星迁移、行星核心吸积、间隙形成和内部光蒸发等多个物理过程。

Result: 模拟显示在盘耗散期间可以形成多种类型的星子，包括散射群、共振群和动力学冷群。卵石吸积的显著增长受到巨行星动力学加热和盘寿命末期快速耗散的双重抑制。参数研究表明这不是普遍情况，结果取决于星子形成和卵石吸积之间对尘埃的竞争。

Conclusion: 该模型与顺序行星形成相结合，为太阳系外区形成模型提供了一个有前景的路径，能够解释多种星子群体的形成和演化。

Abstract: Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the Solar
nebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt are suggested to be the
direct products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary
bodies in the outer Solar System and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key
constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift
and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion,
planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal
photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple
classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation
and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group and a
dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by
both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid
dispersal of the disk towards the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a
parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the
outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal
formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet
formation, this model provides a promising pathway towards an outer Solar
System formation model.

### [4] [A Combined TESS and Ground-based Study of Transit Timing Variations in HAT-P-16, TOI-1516 and TOI-2046 Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21551)
*E. Sonbas,K. Kaplan,M. Tanriver,A. Keskin,K. S. Dhuga,A. Bulut,E. Gogus,W. Ogloza*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过对三颗热木星HAT-P-16b、TOI-1516b和TOI-2046b的光度观测数据，更新了它们的线性星历表，并分析了它们的凌星时间变化。结果表明HAT-P-16b和TOI-1516b更符合轨道衰减模型，而TOI-2046b更适合恒定周期模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究热木星的凌星时间变化(TTVs)对于理解这些系外行星系统的动力学演化、探测可能的伴星以及验证轨道演化理论具有重要意义。

Method: 结合地面望远镜(ADYU60和TUG)和TESS空间望远镜的观测数据，使用线性、轨道衰减和拱线进动模型分析凌星时间变化，并通过贝叶斯信息准则和误报概率评估模型显著性。

Result: TOI-1516b显示出显著的TTV信号(FAP=0.0001)，表明可能存在动力学起源；HAT-P-16b的TTV信号较弱(FAP=0.0055)；TOI-2046b没有统计显著的TTV信号(FAP=0.0196)。

Conclusion: 不同热木星表现出不同的轨道演化特征，TOI-1516b的显著TTV信号值得进一步研究其动力学起源，而其他两颗行星的系统相对稳定。

Abstract: We present new results for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-16b, TOI-1516b, and
TOI-2046b, based on photometric observations collected using both space- and
ground-based facilities. Ground-based data were collected in the 2020-2024 time
span with the 0.6 m telescope (ADYU60) located at the Adiyaman University
Application and Research Center (Adiyaman, T\"{u}rkiye) and the 1.0 m telescope
at the T\"{u}rkiye National Observatory (TUG, T\"{u}rkiye). Through a
combination of fits to our ground-based data, the mid-transit times data from
TESS and additional data taken from the literature, we present an updated
linear ephemeris for each system. Transit timing variations (TTVs) were
analyzed using linear, orbital decay, and apsidal precession models. The
resulting BIC($\Delta$BIC) values indicate that the orbital decay model is
statistically favored for HAT-P-16b and TOI-1516b, while the constant period
model is preferred for TOI-2046b. False alarm probabilities (FAPs) were
computed to assess the significance of any periodic signals. TOI-1516b displays
a strong TTV signal with a FAP (of 0.0001) well below the 0.01 threshold,
suggesting a likely dynamical origin that warrants further investigation. The
higher FAP value (0.0055) for HAT-P-16b suggests that the case of a possible
presence of an additional body in the system is less convincing. In contrast,
the much higher FAP value (0.0196) for TOI-2046b implies that there are no
statistically significant TTVs.

### [5] [Limb Asymmetries on WASP-39b: A Multi-GCM Comparison of Chemistry, Clouds, and Hazes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21588)
*Maria E. Steinrueck,Arjun B. Savel,Duncan A. Christie,Ludmila Carone,Shang-Min Tsai,Can Akın,Thomas D. Kennedy,Sven Kiefer,David A. Lewis,Emily Rauscher,Dominic Samra,Maria Zamyatina,Kenneth Arnold,Robin Baeyens,Leonardos Gkouvelis,David Haegele,Christiane Helling,Nathan J. Mayne,Diana Powell,Michael T. Roman,Hayley Beltz,Néstor Espinoza,Kevin Heng,Nicolas Iro,Eliza M. -R. Kempton,Laura Kreidberg,James Kirk,Matthew M. Murphy,Benjamin V. Rackham,Xianyu Tan*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: JWST首次实现了热木星晨昏两侧光谱的分别观测，发现WASP-39b的昏侧比晨侧有更大的凌星半径和更强的CO₂特征。通过比较五个不同GCM模型，发现虽然模型间温度预测差异很大，但晨昏温差预测一致。非平衡过程消除了甲烷特征，但模型仍无法重现观测到的CO₂特征不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释JWST观测到的WASP-39b晨昏不对称现象，特别是昏侧更大的凌星半径和更强的CO₂特征，需要基于前向模型理解相关物理过程如何影响晨昏光谱。

Method: 使用五个不同的通用环流模型(GCM)进行模拟，包括一个非平衡热化学模型和一个云辐射反馈模型。对所有模拟的温度结构进行二维光化学模型后处理，并对一个模拟进行云微物理模型处理。

Result: 模型预测的晨昏温度差异一致，但温度绝对值差异很大。平衡化学模拟预测晨侧有强甲烷特征，但加入非平衡过程后这些特征消失。然而，即使加入光化学和云过程，模型仍无法重现观测到的约2000 ppm的CO₂特征不对称性。

Conclusion: 需要结合多种因素（如变化的金属丰度和云模型中未探索的参数）来解释观测与模型间的差异，强调未来需要整合云微物理和反馈的模型在更广参数空间中进行研究。

Abstract: With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot
Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported
for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger
transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than
the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences,
photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To
interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of
how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in
forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from
five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating
disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the
recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the
temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one
simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted
by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent
in their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several
equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the
morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium
processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features
disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models
still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$
feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored
parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need
for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader
parameter space.

### [6] [Extreme Geomagnetic Storm on Early Earth Induced by Corotating Interaction Regions from the Young Sun](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21627)
*Dibyendu Sur,Vladimir S. Airapetian*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究模拟了年轻太阳产生的共转相互作用区(CIR)激波对早期地球磁层环境的影响，发现会产生类似现代强磁暴的效应，包括磁层顶压缩、极光区扩张和大气焦耳加热增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究年轻太阳作为磁活跃恒星产生的X射线、极紫外辐射、快速恒星风和CIR激波如何影响早期地球和年轻岩石系外行星的磁层环境和宜居性条件。

Method: 使用空间天气建模框架(SWMF)结合Rice对流模型(RCM)模拟早期地球通过年轻太阳CIR激波时的磁层响应，包括磁层顶位置、极盖电位、焦耳加热等参数。

Result: 模拟显示CIR激波导致磁层顶日侧距离缩短约40%，产生更高的负SYMH指数、极盖电位、大气焦耳加热、场向电流和电子沉降，这些效应与现代强磁暴相当或更强。质子密度增强是电子沉降和焦耳加热的主要因素。

Conclusion: 年轻太阳的磁活动通过CIR激波对早期地球磁层环境产生显著影响，这对理解早期地球和年轻岩石系外行星的宜居性条件具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent multiwavelength observations of young solar analogs suggest that the
young Sun in the first 600 Myr was a magnetically active star that produced an
X-ray and Extreme-UV (EUV) bright corona, fast, massive stellar wind, and
energetic eruptive events. These outputs affected magnetospheric environments
of early Earth and young rocky exoplanets. The interaction of the fast solar
wind with the slow wind produced strong shocks from Corotating Interaction
Regions (CIRs) that provided high dynamic pressure on the magnetospheres of
early Venus, Earth, and Mars. Here, we apply the Space Weather Modeling
Framework (SWMF), coupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the
response of the magnetospheric environments and associated Joule heating
deposited in the upper atmosphere of early Earth as it passed through a CIR
shock from the young Sun. The model suggests ~ 40% closer dayside magnetopause
standoff distance, and higher negative SYMH, Cross Polar Cap Potentials (CPCP),
atmospheric Joule heating, Field Aligned Currents (FAC), electron
precipitations, and equatorward polar cap expansions, comparable or exceeding
those of recent intense and super geomagnetic storms. The magnetic storm
produces dawn-dusk asymmetries in the polar cap boundary arising from the
stellar magnetic field By. The proton density enhancements during the CIR event
are the dominant factor in the overall dynamic pressure for resulting electron
precipitation and Joule heating deposited into the Earth's ionosphere. We
discuss implications for the magnetospheric states and associated habitability
conditions on early Earth and young rocky exoplanets around magnetically active
solar-like stars.

### [7] [Multidisciplinary analysis of pit craters at Hale Crater, Mars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21755)
*Mara Mantegazza,Mauro G. Spagnuolo,Angelo P. Rossi*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文提出火星Hale陨石坑中的坑状洼地可能是由地下冰的升华/融化形成的，与冰川或冰缘环境密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究火星Hale陨石坑中坑状洼地的成因，这些洼地缺乏火山活动或伸展断层的证据，但与冰相关地貌有空间关联。

Method: 通过分析坑状洼地与冰相关地貌的空间关系，排除火山活动和伸展断层成因，并与冰岛冰川环境中的类似洼地进行形态对比。

Result: 发现坑状洼地位于冰相关地貌之上，与冲沟有复杂关系，形态与冰岛冰川环境中的洼地相似，支持地下冰升华/融化成因。

Conclusion: Hale陨石坑的坑状洼地可能由地下冰的升华或融化形成，与冰川或冰缘条件密切相关。

Abstract: Pit craters are circular to subcircular depressions that lack a rim and
ejecta layer and typically have a conical shape. There are several mechanisms
that can explain the formation of such depressions and they are associated with
collapse due to the removal of subsurface material. Possible origins of pit
craters include: volcanic processes (collapse of lava tubes, magmatic chambers,
intrusion of dikes), karstic dissolution, extensional faulting or volatile
processes. Here, we propose that pit craters are stratigraphically on top of
the ice-related landforms and present complex relationships with the gullies.
The spatial relationship between the pits and these structures, along with the
absence of evidence of present or past volcanic activity and the lack of
evidence of any extensional faulting allows us to propose that the origin of
the pit craters in the study area might be related to some volatile process. We
propose here that these particular pit craters at Hale crater, are
morphologically similar to Icelandic depressions located in a glacial
environment. We conclude that the landforms found in the area are in close
relation with glacial or periglacial conditions and pit craters might be formed
by sublimation/melting of ground ice.

### [8] [Starshades as technosignatures in direct imaging phase curves: Application to the Habitable Worlds Observatory targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22301)
*Claudia I. Skoglund,Alexander J. Mustill*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在宜居世界天文台(HWO)任务中探测围绕恒星运行的人造遮星结构（遮星伞）的可能性。遮星伞被模拟为位于恒星和行星之间拉格朗日内点的圆形反射面，其相位曲线与典型行星具有明显不同的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着恒星在主序带演化，其光度增加会导致轨道行星表面温度升高。技术先进的文明可能会安装遮星伞来减少行星接收的辐射，这些结构可能被当前或近未来技术探测到。

Method: 模拟了在HWO目标系统中假设遮星伞的直接成像相位曲线特征。遮星伞被假定为位于恒星和行星之间内拉格朗日点的圆形反射表面。

Result: 遮星伞的相位曲线与典型行星相比具有明显不同的形状。在预期内工作角约60毫角秒时，70.8%的目标恒星相位曲线特征高于望远镜对比度单次访问精度1σ=10^-11。如果内工作角能减小到45毫角秒，这一比例增加到96.7%。

Conclusion: 只要内工作角足够小，HWO应该能够探测到由遮星伞或类似高反射表面引起的光变曲线异常，这些异常可能作为技术先进文明的关键指示器。

Abstract: A star's luminosity increases as it evolves along the Main Sequence (MS),
which inevitably results in a higher surface temperature for planets in orbit
around the star. Technologically advanced civilizations may tackle this issue
by installing artificial structures -- starshades -- which can reduce the
radiation received by the planet. Starshades, if they exist, are potentially
detectable with current or near-future technology. We have simulated phase
curve signatures in direct imaging of hypothetical starshades in systems
targeted by the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will be
tasked with searching for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The
starshade is assumed to be a circular, reflecting surface placed at the inner
Lagrange point between the star and the planet. Our results show that the phase
curve of a starshade has a distinct shape compared to that of a typical planet.
The phase curve signature lies above the expected $1\sigma=10^{-11}$
single-visit precision in contrast ratio of the telescope for 70.8% of the
target stars for the expected inner working angle (IWA) of around 60 mas. If
the IWA can be reduced to 45 mas, the percentage of stars above the $1\sigma$
limit increases to 96.7%. With a sufficiently small IWA, HWO should be able to
detect anomalies in light curves caused by starshades or similar
highly-reflective surfaces -- which could serve as key indicators for
technologically advanced civilizations.

### [9] [Ion-neutral chemistry at icy moons: the case of Ganymede](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22316)
*A. Beth,M. Galand,X. Jia,F. Leblanc*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了木卫三（Ganymede）的电离层组成，通过升级测试粒子代码包含离子-中性粒子碰撞，发现除了已知的H₂O⁺、H₂⁺和O₂⁺外，还存在H₃⁺、H₃O⁺和O₂H⁺等离子种类，这些发现对解释Juno和未来JUICE任务的数据至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去观测显示木卫三存在电离层和H₃⁺离子，这表明离子和中性粒子可能仍在碰撞并产生新的离子种类，需要研究木卫三是否拥有比之前认为更多样化的电离层组成。

Method: 升级了木卫三电离层的测试粒子代码，从无碰撞模型改为以概率方式包含离子-中性粒子碰撞，并将更新后的代码应用于三个伽利略号飞越木卫三的任务数据。

Result: 发现木卫三电离层不仅包含H₂O⁺、H₂⁺和O₂⁺等离子，还包含H₃⁺、H₃O⁺和O₂H⁺等离子，H₃⁺和H₃O⁺在某些区域的贡献可能很显著，且存在强烈的昼夜不对称性和木星/反木星侧不对称性。

Conclusion: 木卫三的电离层组成比之前认为的更加多样化，这些发现对于解释Juno和未来JUICE任务的离子质谱仪数据具有重要意义。

Abstract: Icy moons orbiting giant planets are often described as airless bodies though
they host an exosphere where collisions between neutral species are scarce. In
the case of Ganymede, the neutral composition is dominated by $\mathrm{H_2O}$,
$\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$. Past observations by Galileo showed that
Ganymede hosts an ionosphere and those by Juno revealed the presence of
$\mathrm{H_3^+}$, an ion species only stemming from ion-neutral collisions.
$\mathrm{H_3^+}$ detection suggests that ions and neutrals might still collide
and be the source of new ion species on icy moons. We examine Ganymede's
ability to host a more diverse ionosphere in terms of ion composition than
previously thought and predict its variety. We upgraded our test-particle code
of Ganymede's ionosphere, formerly collisionless, to include ion-neutral
collisions in a probabilistic manner. The updated code is applied to three
Galileo flybys of Ganymede that were investigated in the absence of chemistry.
Both sets of simulations have been compared and the effect of ion-neutral
chemistry has been assessed. We show that in the case of an exosphere
predominantly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$,
the ionosphere is made not only of their associated cations but also of
$\mathrm{H_3^+}$, $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$, and $\mathrm{O_2H^+}$. Simulations reveal
that, depending on the location, the contribution of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ and
$\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ to the ion composition may be significant. Strong
dayside/nightside and Jovian/anti-Jovian asymmetries in the ion composition are
identified. Our findings are key to interpreting Juno and future JUICE ion mass
spectrometer datasets.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Small bodies exist in distinct populations within their planetary systems.
These reservoir populations hold a range of compositions, which to first order
are dependent on formation location relative to their star. We provide a
general overview of the nature of the reservoirs that source exocomets, from
the influence of the stellar environment through planetesimal formation to
comparisons with Solar System populations. Once transitioned from a young
protoplanetary disc to a debris disc, a star can expect to be rained with
exocomets. While exocomets are predominantly detected to date at A-type stars,
planetesimals plausibly exist across a range of stellar masses, based on
exoplanet abundance, debris disc occurrence and white dwarf infall.

### [11] [Small Near-Earth Objects in the Taurid Resonant Swarm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22602)
*Quanzhi Ye,Jasmine Li,Denis Vida,David L. Clark,Eric C. Bellm*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 金牛座共振群可能包含多达约100个通古斯大小和约1000个车里雅宾斯克大小的天体，撞击频率低于每400万年一次，但这些估计基于未经验证的轨道分布假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金牛座共振群已知富含亚米级粒子，但不确定这种增强是否延伸到更大的小行星大小天体。

Method: 重新分析ZTF在2022年TRS相遇期间获得的数据，并基于火球大小流星体的轨道分布假设进行估计。

Result: TRS可能包含约100个通古斯大小和约1000个车里雅宾斯克大小的天体，后者与火流星记录估计一致，撞击频率低于每400万年一次。

Conclusion: 这些数字基于未经验证的轨道分布假设，未来像Vera C. Rubin天文台这样的广域设施可以利用2020-30年代TRS的近距离接近来验证这些约束。

Abstract: The Taurid Resonant Swarm (TRS) within the Taurid Complex hosts
dynamically-concentrated debris in a 7:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.
Fireball observations have confirmed that the TRS is rich in sub-meter-sized
particles, but whether this enhancement extends to larger, asteroid-sized
objects remains unclear. Here we reanalyze the data obtained by a Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF) campaign during the 2022 TRS encounter, and find that
the TRS may host up to $\sim10^2$ Tunguska-sized objects and up to $\sim10^3$
Chelyabinsk-sized objects, the latter of which agrees the estimate derived from
bolide records. This translates to an impact frequency of less than once every
4 million years. However, we caution that these numbers are based on the
unverified assumption that the orbital distribution of the TRS asteroids
follows that of fireball-sized meteoroids. Future wide-field facilities, such
as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, could take advantage of TRS's close
approaches in the 2020-30s and validate the constraints of the asteroid-sized
objects in the TRS.
