We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of ~1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\\rm belt} \\propto L_{\\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\\,M_\\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\\,M_\\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\\rm belt}^n$ with $n>2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of ~1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528SPHERE\u89c2\u6d4b161\u9897\u5e74\u8f7b\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u4e8651\u4e2a\u788e\u7247\u76d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b04\u4e2a\u65b0\u76d8\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b9\u4e2a\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5149\u5ea6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c18\u57c3\u8d28\u91cf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7SPHERE\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9897\u7c92\u7279\u6027\u968f\u6052\u661f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SPHERE\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b161\u9897\u5e74\u8f7b\u6052\u661f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u692d\u5706\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7f51\u683c\u63a8\u5bfc\u76d8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4fee\u6b63\u9ed1\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790SED\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u5c18\u57c3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u8d28\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7531\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u884c\u661f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u6790\u4e8651\u4e2a\u788e\u7247\u76d8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec4\u4e2a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b\u5728HD 114082\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u51cc\u65e5\u5de8\u884c\u661f\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b9\u4e2a\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5185\u5916\u5e26\u534a\u5f84\u6bd41.5-2\uff1b\u76d8\u534a\u5f84\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5149\u5ea6\u5448\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5728CO\u548cCO\u2082\u51bb\u7ed3\u533a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u5c18\u57c3\u5149\u5ea6\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5c18\u57c3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u76d8\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d8\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u5c18\u57c3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4f30\u7b97\u5c18\u57c3\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u548c\u6700\u5927\u504f\u632f\u5206\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases.

Astronomical observations show solar mass-protostellar fluxes are a factor $\u03a6\\approx 3 \\times 10^2 - 3 \\times 10^3$ times higher than the present-day Sun. Constraining $\u03a6$ in the early solar system is important for modeling ionization in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, the extent of magnetorotational instability or magnetocentrifugal outflows, or even production of short-lived radionuclides. Recent interpretations of meteoritic data -- cosmogenic Ne in hibonite grains, initial $({}^{10}{\\rm Be}/{}^{9}{\\rm Be})_0$ ratios in Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), or even inferences of live ${}^{7}{\\rm Be}$ in CAIs -- have suggested values $\u03a6> 10^5$, even as large as $\u03a6\\approx 6 \\times 10^6$, which would make the young Sun extraordinarily active, even for a protostar. We constrain $\u03a6$ by re-examining these data. We conclude: cosmogenic Ne was produced in hibonite grains as they resided in the disk; ${}^{36}{\\rm Cl}$ was created in Cl-poor grains after the disk dissipated; ${}^{10}{\\rm Be}$ was inherited from the molecular cloud, with almost no ($< 1\\%$) ${}^{10}{\\rm Be}$ created in the disk; and there is no evidence whatsoever for any live ${}^{7}{\\rm Be}$ in CAIs.

We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $\u03ba$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2\u00b0, which makes $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $\u03ba$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $\u03ba$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $\u03ba$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528MATISSE\u548cGRAVITY\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u89c2\u6d4b\u03ba Tuc A\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5176\u4f34\u661f\u03ba Tuc Ab\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u8f68\u9053\u89e3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u8f68\u9053\u4e0e\u70ed\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u7684\u5173\u8054", "motivation": "\u03ba Tuc A\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5df2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u8d85\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u786e\u8ba4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5148\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4e0e\u70ed\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u751a\u5927\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea(VLTI)\u7684MATISSE\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548cGRAVITY\u4eea\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7MATISSE\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u5229\u7528GRAVITY\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u8f68\u9053\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u03ba Tuc Ab\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u5176L\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6d41\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3b\u661f\u4e3a1.32%\uff0c\u662fMATISSE\u95ed\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f34\u661f\u3002\u83b7\u5f97\u5176\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\uff1a\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u4e3a0.94\uff0c\u534a\u957f\u8f74\u4e3a4.8au\u3002\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u5149\u8c31\u7c7b\u578b\u4e3aM3.5V\u5230M4.5V\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u4f34\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e862012\u548c2014\u5e74\u7684\u70ed\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca2019\u5e74\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u03ba Tuc Ab\u4f34\u661f\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u5728\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3001\u70ed\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u661f\u5b50\u5e93\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The current predictions for the Roman Coronagraph's detection limit range from 1e-8 to a few 1e-9, which would allow for groundbreaking science, such as potentially imaging Jupiter-like planets. However, the performance of the instrument depends on many factors. Simulating images with varying optical error sources can help us connect instrument and observatory performance to science yield. Here we present corosims, a tool to simulate observations of astrophysical scenes with the Coronagraph with evolving errors. This tool wraps around the Coronagraph PROPER diffraction model and detector simulator. We use it to investigate the potential degeneracy between jitter-induced speckles and both hot and warm exozodi disk structures. First, we simulate observations of exozodi around Tau Ceti, with varying jitter. We predict that with nominal post-correction pointing jitter performance (~0.3 mas RMS), the Roman Coronagraph should be sensitive to 12x zodis worth of dust, assuming a face-on (worst case scenario) inclination. We further predict that its sensitivity degrades to 35x zodis if jitter on-target is 3x worse than the nominal value. This estimate assumes the best-modeled wavefront control and stability values from the project, including additional model uncertainty factors. We find that, while jitter hinders warm exozodi detection, jitter residuals are unlikely to result in a false positive. However, if a faint hot exozodi falls at small separation, it may not be distinguishable from jitter-induced speckle residuals of comparable brightness. Finally, we discuss the degeneracies induced between flux and separation retrieved near the inner working angle due the sharp edge of the Roman Coronagraph's focal plane mask.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1corosims\u5de5\u5177\u6a21\u62df\u7f57\u9a6c\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6296\u52a8\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eea\u5668\u5bf9\u5c18\u57c3\u76d8\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u7f57\u9a6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u5c06\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9c\u5c45\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u5960\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6296\u52a8\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u76d8\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u5e94", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1corosims\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5305\u88c5PROPER\u884d\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u6296\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5206\u6790\u6296\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6591\u70b9\u4e0e\u70ed/\u6696\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6", "result": "\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u6296\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b12\u500d\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u76d8\u91cf\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\uff1b\u6296\u52a8\u6076\u53163\u500d\u65f6\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u964d\u81f335\u500d\uff1b\u6296\u52a8\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u6696\u5c18\u76d8\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f46\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff1b\u5c0f\u5206\u79bb\u89d2\u5904\u7684\u5fae\u5f31\u70ed\u5c18\u76d8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6296\u52a8\u6591\u70b9\u6df7\u6dc6", "conclusion": "\u6296\u52a8\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7f57\u9a6c\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u5bf9\u7cfb\u5916\u9ec4\u9053\u5c18\u76d8\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u79bb\u89d2\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u79d1\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\u975e\u5e38\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5468\u671f\u22647\u5929\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u5171\u632f\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5f53\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8fdb\u52a8\u4e0e\u884c\u661f\u725b\u987f\u8fdb\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u884c\u661f\u4f1a\u88ab\u5171\u632f\u6355\u83b7\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u88ab\u9a71\u9010\u6216\u541e\u566c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u7d27\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5468\u671f\u22647\u5929\uff09\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5230\u51cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f3a\u5931\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u957f\u671f\u5171\u632f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u53cc\u661f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8fdb\u52a8\u4e0e\u884c\u661f\u725b\u987f\u8fdb\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u7684\u5171\u632f\u6355\u83b7\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u9053\u5e73\u5747\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u884c\u661f\u4e0e\u53cc\u661f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff1a80%\u7684\u884c\u661f\u4f1a\u906d\u9047\u5e76\u88ab\u5171\u632f\u6355\u83b7\uff1b75%\u7684\u884c\u661f\u4f1a\u88ab\"\u6467\u6bc1\"\uff08\u9a71\u9010\u6216\u541e\u566c\uff09\uff1b\u5e78\u5b58\u8005\u5219\u5904\u4e8e\u9065\u8fdc\u3001\u4f4e\u51cc\u661f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u4f1a\u6e05\u9664\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u884c\u661f\u7f3a\u5931\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\\, \\mathrm{k_B\\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\\, \\mathrm{k_B\\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\\, \\mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6728\u661f\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6e29\u6696\u3001\u5bcc\u542b\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u7a00\u91ca\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u534a\u5f84\u7ea61.89\u500d\u6728\u661f\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6728\u661f\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u81f3\u4eca\u4ecd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6728\u661f\u5185\u536b\u661f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u73b0\u4eca\u6728\u661f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u951a\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6728\u661f\u5185\u536b\u661f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e864,250\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6210\u5206\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u6c26\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u71b5\u548c\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u6728\u661f\u73b0\u4eca\u7ed3\u6784\u6700\u4f73\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6e29\u6696\uff084.98\u00b13.00 k_B m_u^{-1}\uff09\u3001\u5bcc\u542b\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u7a00\u91ca\u6838\u5fc3\u3002\u4e3a\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6728\u661f\u539f\u59cb\u81ea\u8f6c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5176\u5305\u5c42\u5728\u76d8\u6d88\u6563\u65f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff089.32\u00b10.48 k_B m_u^{-1}\uff09\u3002\u786e\u5b9a\u6728\u661f\u539f\u59cb\u534a\u5f84\u4e3a1.89\u00b10.40 R_J\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6728\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u5143\u7d20\u5728\u6c14\u4f53\u5feb\u901f\u5438\u79ef\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u5df2\u5438\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5438\u79ef\u6fc0\u6ce2\u671f\u95f4\u8017\u6563\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}
