A popular technique for modeling stellar activity is\nto apply a quasiperiodic Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which provides a\nflexible model with rigorous error propagation. However, observers must guard\nagainst overfitting, as a GP may be flexible enough to subsume other signals\nbesides the one it is intended to model. To counteract overfitting, we\nintroduce a curvature-penalizing objective function for fitting GP models to\nlong-term magnetic activity cycles. We also demonstrate that a Gaussian filter\ncan be an effective method of detrending radial velocities (RVs) so that\nshorter-period signals can be extracted even in the absence of a mathematical\nmodel of the long-term trend. We apply our methods to the heavily studied 55\nCancri system, fitting Keplerian orbits plus the GP activity-cycle model. We\nshow that a 4-Keplerian model that includes planets b, c, e, and f combined\nwith a GP for the activity cycle performs at least as well as the widely\nagreed-upon 5-planet system with its own GP activity model. Our results suggest\nthat the existence of planet d cannot be established from the RVs alone;\nadditional data are required for confirmation."}

Traditional\napproaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within\nthe Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models\nassume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine\nlearning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n(PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This\nwork introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that\nformulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D\ngrid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations,\nMasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid\nshape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on\ndiverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic\nplanetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across\nmultiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational\nefficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than\nGeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass\ndistributions.

Using a sample of 108 confirmed brown dwarf companions\nfrom the NASA Exoplanet Archive with masses between 13-80 Jupiter masses and\norbital semi-major axes between 0.1-5.0 AU, we employ Kolmogorov-Smirnov\nstatistical (KS) tests to compare observed orbital distributions with three\nproposed formation scenarios: (A) disk migration with stellar infall, (B) core\naccretion with mass-dependent survival probability, and (C) formation bias\nthrough dynamical migration. Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27\nparameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for\nformation bias models.
