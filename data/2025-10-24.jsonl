Direct Formation of Gas Giants via Disk Fragmentation", "comment": "23 pages, 14 figures; Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Gravitational instability (GI) has long been considered a viable pathway for\ngiant planet formation in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), especially at wide\norbital separations or around low-mass stars where core accretion faces\nsignificant challenges. However, a primary drawback is that disk fragmentation\nfrom GI was generally found to produce over-massive clumps, typically in the\nmass range of brown dwarfs, although most numerical studies adopted simplified\ncooling prescriptions or with limited numerical resolution. We conduct a suite\nof global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of\nself-gravitating PPDs using the meshless finite-mass (MFM) method. By\nimplementing radiation transport via the M1 closure and systematically varying\ndisk mass and opacity, we show that increasing disk mass and lowering opacity\npromote fragmentation by enhancing radiative cooling. Non-fragmenting disks\nsettle into a gravito-turbulent state with low-order spiral structures and\neffective angular momentum transport characterized by $\\alpha \\sim\n\\beta_\\mathrm{cool}^{-1}$. In fragmenting disks, a subset of gravitationally\nbound clumps survives as long-lived fragments. Their initial masses form a\nconsistent distribution around $\\Sigma \\cdot\\lambda_\\mathrm{T} \\cdot 2\n(c_s/\\Omega_\\mathrm{K})$ (with $\\lambda_T$ the Toomre wavelength),\ncorresponding to $\\sim 0.3 - 10\\,M_\\mathrm{J}$ in our simulations, consistent\nwith being gas giants. These results demonstrate that GI can produce\nplanet-mass fragments under more realistic conditions, reinforcing it as a\nviable gas giant formation pathway and motivating further studies of fragment\nevolution and observational signatures."}

Although trace amounts of water are seen across all\nphases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes\nundetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to\nplanets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and\n(exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water\nmolecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue\nratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to\nanswer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an\nenhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O\nratio of $(3.2 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in\nprotostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than\nexpected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest\nisotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \\pm 1.0) \\times $HDO/H$_2$O further\nestablishes the inheritance of water. We conclude that water ice in disks\noriginates from the earliest phases of star formation, providing the missing\nlink between cold dark clouds and (exo-)comets."}

Here we use\nnumerical simulations to show that Jupiter's early formation reshaped its natal\nprotoplanetary disk.

The SSES corresponds to two non-spherical gravitationally interacting\nbodies, settled in nearly circular relative orbit, with rotation axes normal to\nthe orbital plane, rapid rotation of the primary and synchronous rotation of\nthe secondary. In the present paper we remove all simplifying assumptions of\nour previous work Gaitanas et. al., 2024, and show how to compute analytical\nsolutions describing a 3-dimensional perturbation of the system from the SSES\nin the framework of two distinct theories, called `linear' and `nonlinear'.\nLinear theory stems from averaging the equations of motion over the primary's\nrapid rotation angle. This maps the SSES to an equilibrium point of the\naveraged system, around which analytical solutions can be computed by\nlinearization of the equations of motion. In nonlinear theory, instead, we\ncompute a high order normal form for the Hamiltonian of motion through a\nsequence of canonical transformations in the form of series. Resonances between\nthe basic system's frequencies appear in the nonlinear theory as small\ndivisors. We show that, close to resonances, the nonlinear theory leads to a\npartially integrable model, sufficient to analytically describe the evolution\nof the relative orbit, but only of some of the Euler angles of the system. As a\nbasic application, we compute analytical solutions representing various\npossible Didymos-Dimorphos post-impact orbital and rotational states.
