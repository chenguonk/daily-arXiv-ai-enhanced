However, the\nspatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear.\nHere, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering\nthe fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our\nresults show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2,\na finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the\namplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of\n~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where\nthe regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust\nregions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future\nlanding site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon."}

These measurements are enabled by combining projected\nrotational velocities, planetary rotation periods, and astrometric orbits for\ndirectly-imaged super-Jupiters. This approach constrains both the spin axis and\norbital inclination relative to the line of sight, allowing obliquity\nmeasurements for individual systems and offering new insights into their\nformation. To test whether these super-Jupiters form more like scaled-up\nplanets or scaled-down stars, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to\ninfer their population-level obliquity distribution. Using a single-parameter\nFisher distribution, we compare two models: a planet-like formation scenario\n($\\kappa=5$) predicting moderate alignment, versus a brown dwarf-like formation\nscenario ($\\kappa=0$) predicting isotropic obliquities. Based on a sample of\nfour young super-Jupiter systems, we find early evidence favoring the isotropic\ncase with a Bayes factor of 15, consistent with turbulent fragmentation."}

The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary\nfrom the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of\nthe binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR)\nmay suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider\nrestricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a\ntest-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called\n\"limiting eccentricity\") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of\nthe tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high\nhierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show\nthat the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the\nsame limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the\nquadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks\ndown and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction\nterm; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we\nemploy the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity\nin the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical\nscaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model."}

The\nnear-ultraviolet (NUV) regime is particularly sensitive to extended upper\natmospheric and magnetospheric structures. We investigate whether star-planet\ninteractions in the WASP-189 system could plausibly account for the early\ningress feature suggested by NUV transit fitting models. We analyzed three NUV\ntransits of WASP-189b observed as part of the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit\nExperiment (CUTE), which employs a 6U CubeSat dedicated to exoplanet\nspectroscopy. To explore whether the observed transit asymmetry could plausibly\narise from a magnetospheric bow shock (MBS), we performed magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations using representative stellar wind velocities and planetary\natmospheric densities. During Visit 3, we identified an approximately\n31.5-minute phase offset that is consistent with an early ingress. Our MHD\nsimulations indicate that with a wind speed of 573 km s-1 and an upper\natmospheric density of about 4.6e-11 kg m-3, a higher-density zone due to\ncompression can form ahead of the planet within five planetary radii where the\nfast-mode Mach number falls below ~0.56, even without a MBS. Shock cooling and\ncrossing time estimates suggest that such a pileup could produce detectable NUV\nabsorption. Our results indicate that while MBS formation is feasible for\nWASP-189b, low stellar-wind speeds favor NUV-detectable magnetic pileups over\nclassical bow shocks and enhance the potential detectability of early-ingress\nsignatures."}

By analysing spectra from the\nEuropean Fireball Network (EN) that exhibit H$\\alpha$ and Si~II emissions, we\ninvestigated the relationship between H and Si abundances across different\nmeteoroid types. The plasma temperature of the high-temperature component\nremains independent of meteor velocity. This allows us to directly compare\nrelative intensities of volatile hydrogen with less volatile silicon in bodies\nwith different velocities. Our results confirmed that the H/Si value remains\nlargely independent of meteor velocity. We show a positive correlation with\nphotometric mass for cometary meteoroids, suggesting that larger bodies better\npreserve their volatile content, namely hydrogen. This correlation persists\nacross the meteor showers, showing a physical process related to volatile\npreservation rather than specific parent body composition. Our data suggest\nthat the abundance of hydrogen in large cometary meteoroids is not only higher\nthan in CI chondrites, but is also comparable to or higher than the measured\nabundances in small particles of dust from Halley's comet, depending on the\nassumed plasma conditions. This work brought new constraints on the\ndistribution and preservation of volatile elements in Solar System bodies and\nnew insights into the potential delivery mechanisms of water to Earth. The\nprevalence of hydrogen in larger cometary meteoroids supports models where\ncomets could be significant contributors to Earth's volatile inventory."}

We\nhave employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V)\nfilters.

The primary\nfocus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host\nstar using the transit method. The application of different filters was\nexpected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as\nthe exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's\nsize appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V\nfilter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to\ndetermine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the\norbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration\n(measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results\nindicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than\nthose with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes,\nrespectively.

We find that the slope for the relationship $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$\nflattens over time as populations age, possibly explaining the differences seen\nbetween the L1641-N and L1641-S clusters in Orion A. We determine that\n$\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ depends on the stellar mass where more massive stars exhibit\nsteeper gradients than their lesser counterparts, in agreement with the\ndifferences seen between Herbig and T Tauri stars. Additionally, the strength\nof the mechanism for angular momentum transport, either viscosity or MHD disc\nwinds, is found to significantly affect $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ with stronger\n$\\alpha$ values reducing $\\lambda_{\\rm UV}$ due to more material accreting on\nto the central stars in weaker UV environments.

The surface free energy (SFE) of the\ndust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other\nafter collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which\nfragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate,\nsilica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary\ndust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures,\nand a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular\ndynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica,\nalbite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true\nvacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing\ntemperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More\ndramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of\nmagnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our\nresults confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of\nwater produces this reduction in SFE in experiments.
