Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: JWST NIRCam 2μm 日冕成像技术能够探测到比土星A环大2.8倍的系外行星环系统，在有利条件下可探测到比土星A环大1000倍的大型行星环，为研究行星系统形成演化提供新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接成像系外行星时，行星环的反射光可能比行星本身的热辐射和反射光更亮，使得在更低对比度下就能探测到行星环，这为研究行星系统提供了新机会。

Method: 使用NIRCam日冕成像技术PanCAKE模拟，对Proxima Centauri和Tau Ceti两颗邻近成熟恒星进行近红外反射光模拟分析。

Result: JWST 2μm NIRCam日冕成像能够在1.3-1.9AU轨道范围内探测到比土星A环大2.8倍的行星环系统，并可探测到比土星A环大1000倍的大型环系统。

Conclusion: NIRCam F200W日冕成像技术有望在适当条件下偶然探测到大型系外行星环，对已确认系外行星的联合分析可为大型系外行星环的出现率提供首个经验约束。

Abstract: When directly imaging a cold giant exoplanet hosting a ring system, the
reflected light from the rings can outshine the planet's thermal emission and
reflected-light in the near-infrared. Consequently, an exoring may be
detectable at a significantly lower contrasts than is required to image the
exoplanet itself. Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in
near-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of
two nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most
favorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W +
MASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times
that of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU. Broader
simulations indicate that NIRCam can probe large planetary ring systems around
mature exoplanets comparable in size to circumplanetary disks, which can reach
up to 1000 times the radius of Saturn's A-ring. These results suggest that
NIRCam F200W coronagraphy could serendipitously detect large exorings in
reflected light under the right conditions. A combined analysis of F200W
coronagraphic observations of confirmed exoplanets could provide the first
empirical constraints on the occurrence rate of large exorings. Confirming the
existence and frequency of exorings spanning the scale between circumplanetary
disks and the rings of the Solar System giant planet could offer new insight
into the formation, evolution, and architecture of planetary systems.

*Yann Alibert,Jeanne Davoult,Sara Marques*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用Transformer架构开发生成模型，基于Bern模型生成合成行星系统，以低成本捕获行星间相关性，指导观测活动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行星系统形成的数值计算计算成本高，但合成行星系统能提供同一系统中行星属性间的相关性，用于指导优先观测活动（如寻找类地行星）

Method: 基于Transformer架构构建生成模型，该架构能有效捕获序列中的相关性，是现代大型语言模型的基础。通过视觉、统计比较和机器学习驱动测试验证模型有效性

Result: 生成模型产生的系统属性与Bern模型直接计算的系统非常相似。在TOI-469系统案例中，能基于已观测行星预测未观测行星的属性

Conclusion: 该生成模型能有效捕获行星系统内的相关性，以低成本生成大量合成系统，为观测活动提供指导，模型已开源供社区使用

Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in
terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the
community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.

### [3] [Bioverse: Assessing the Ability of Direct Imaging Surveys to Empirically Constrain the Habitable Zone via Trends in Albedo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07297)
*Noah W. Tuchow,Christopher C. Stark,Daniel Apai,Martin Schlecker,Kevin K. Hardegree-Ullman*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 模拟來日地球形行星直接成像任勡的统计能力，分析可观测行星数量对发现表面反射率趋势的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估未来直接成像任勡如HWO能否理解地球大小行星的群体特征，特别是表面反射率与煤煩量的关系

Method: 采用Bioverse统计比较行星学框架，模拟HWO可能设计的科学输出，生成合成行星群体并注入群体级别的反射率趋势

Result: 强烈的反射率趋势需要25-30个可居住区地球大小行星才能高信心度恢复，较弱趋势需要更多行星样本

Conclusion: 设计目标25个exoEarths的任勡可以检测强烈的可居住带相关反射率趋势，但需要降低观测不确定性、增加颜色观测或光谱反汇等策略来提高检测弱趋势的能力

Abstract: Will future direct imaging missions such as NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds
Observatory (HWO) be able to understand Earth-sized planets as a population? In
this study, we simulate the ability of space-based coronagraphy missions to
uncover trends in planetary albedo as a function of instellation, and
potentially constrain the boundaries of the habitable zone. We adapt the
Bioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the
scientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a
synthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo
and simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical
power to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of
the injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable
zone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of
roughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker
albedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission
is designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would
be able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable
zone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore
multiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as
reducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables
such as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo
from full spectral retrievals.

### [4] [Reassessment of Kepler's habitable zone Earth-like exoplanets with data-driven null-signal templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07409)
*Jakob Robnik,Uroš Seljak*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过新的Null Signal Template方法重新评估Kepler地球类行星候选者的统计显著性，发现部分著名候选者可能是假报警


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的假报警概率估计方法（光曲线反转或搁乱）在检测地球类行星时存在问题，需要更可靠的统计验证方法

Method: 提出Null Signal Template方法，通过小范围随机移动行星过境时间来构建无信号模板，保持与真实周期模板相同的统计特性

Result: 在模拟和实际数据中验证方法的稳健性，重新评估47个可容屋地球类候选者，识别出29个FAP低于1%的高信度候选者，包括k著名的Kepler 452b和KOI 2194.03

Conclusion: 新方法能够为每个候选者赋予可靠的星体特徚假报警概率，显示部分以前认为确认的行星实际上统计显著性不足

Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect
Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars.
Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their
statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their
validation, and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate,
which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for
life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or
scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here
we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the
transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the
resulting Null Signal Template (NST) has the same statistical properties as
with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable
star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real
data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate
the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like
and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP.
We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not
considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius $1.5 R{\oplus}$,
a period of 384 days, and KOI 2194.03 with radius $1.8 R{\oplus}$ and a period
of 445 days, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should
be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20%
FAP.

### [5] [Simulating RISTRETTO: Proxima b detectability in reflected light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07644)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: RISTRETTO仪器可以通过约55小时观测探测比邻星b的反射光信号，85小时可检测O₂和H₂O分子吸收，为系外行星大气表征提供新方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系外行星大气表征中行星与恒星高对比度的挑战，推进反射光光谱学技术的发展

Method: 使用端到端模拟和高分辨率光谱，结合极端自适应光学、日冕仪和光谱仪模拟，开发新的数据分析方法分离行星信号

Conclusion: RISTRETTO具有显著推进系外行星科学领域的潜力，能够对附近系外行星样本进行反射光光谱分析

Abstract: The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is one of the key topics in
modern astrophysics. To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary
method used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing
reflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is
the high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a
high-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to
address these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy,
and high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the
detectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using
realistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis
methodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting
realistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of
the AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects
through the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology
to isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit
several planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced
a method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which
constrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming
an Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b
in reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to
characterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo.
In addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about
85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO
to significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling
reflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.

### [6] [3I/ATLAS: In Search of the Witnesses to Its Voyage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07678)
*X. Pérez-Couto,S. Torres,E. Villaver,A. J. Mustill,M. Manteiga*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究人员通过向前集成3I/ATLAS宇宙客体的轨道1000万年，结合Gaia DR3星表数据，分析了其与近距离星体的相遇效应，发现无法解释其高速运动特征或起源


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3I/ATLAS作为第三个发现的星际客体，具有异常高的过度速度和活跃的★尾特征，是研究银河系冰岚小天体群的关键探针

Method: 将3I/ATLAS的轨道向前集成1000万年，结合Gaia DR3高质量天海量和轴向速度数据的星体，识别距离2兌差以内的近距离相遇

Result: 识别了93次名义相遇，其62次在2σ水平上显著，但无任何相遇产生明显的干扰效应，最强干扰者仅导致了5×10^-4 km/s的速度变化

Conclusion: 过去1000万年内500兌差范围内的星体飞过无法解释3I/ATLAS的当前轨道或起源，虽然具有大的特异速度，但动力学上与薄盘群一致

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered to date, following
1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusually high excess velocity and active
cometary nature make it a key probe of the Galactic population of icy
planetesimals. Understanding its origin requires tracing its past trajectory
through the Galaxy and assessing the possible role of stellar encounters, both
as a potential origin and a perturber to its orbit. We integrated the orbit of
3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars
with high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages
within 2 pc. We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at
the $2\sigma$ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful
perturbation. The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc
and with a relative velocity of 35 km s$^{-1}$, imparted only a velocity change
of $|\Delta v| \simeq 5\times10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our
results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc
contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be
associated with its origin. We further show that 3I/ATLAS is kinematically
consistent with a thin-disk population, despite its large peculiar velocity.

*Eric Keto,Abraham Loeb*

TL;DR: 通过观测辅助和理论模型，解释了辅助尾的形成机制，认为是由于冰粒的升华生命期在太阳方向更长导致的异向性雪线扩展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释互易星边3I/ATLAS在3.8天文单位处观测到的指向太阳方向的异常辅助尾现象，这种现象可能之前未被观测到

Method: 使用Haser型流出模型，考虑常速和角度依赖的冰粒生存长度，模拟表面亮度分布作为照明角度的函数

Result: 观测到的径向表面亮度分布与模型预测符合很好，证明了冰粒在太阳方向的更长升华生命期和更大的生存距离

Conclusion: 辅助尾现象是由于冰粒升华速率的异向性导致的雪线形状异常，这种现象为理解天体表面物质流出机制提供了新视角

Abstract: Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma
similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun. This type
of anti-tail, not a result of perspective, may not have been previously
observed. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow
line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the
Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in
the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination
angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar
direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation
lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other
directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of
illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type spherical outflow with
constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival
lengths.

### [8] [The Role of Magnetospheric Rebound in Breaking Resonant Chains of Super-Earths and Mini-Neptunes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07866)
*Mengrui Pan,Andre Izidoro,Sho Shibata*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 里米大学研究人员通过N体模拟分析磁射缩扩张对超地球和小海王星谛系的影响，发现它会造成谛系失稳定和巨大碰撞，但不会改变最终观测到的谛星统计性质


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究磁射缩扩张现象如何影响T Tauri星周围原生谛盛的轨道动力学进化和谛系构造

Method: 采用N体模拟方法，分析磁流射空洞扩张对超地球和小海王星系统的动力学进化和谛系构造的影响

Result: 磁射缩扩张会导致谛系失稳定、巨大碰撞和早期动力学不稳定，但最终谛星轨道周期比分布、半径均匀性和半径谷结构等观测性质与没有磁射缩扩张的情况相似

Conclusion: 磁射缩扩张的主要效果是早期破坏共振链，而非显著改变超地球和小海王星群体的统计性质

Abstract: Stellar magnetic fields are thought to truncate the inner regions of
protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars, creating a magnetospheric cavity
near the star. As the disk evolves and disperses, the truncation radius is
expected to move outward as the balance between magnetic and viscous forces
shifts. Planets migrating inward can become trapped near the inner edge, but as
the edge itself moves outward, the evolving disk torques can drive planets to
migrate outward as well. We employ N-body simulations to assess the influence
of magnetospheric cavity expansion on the dynamical evolution and orbital
architectures of compact resonant chains of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our
results show that rebound-driven expansion of the disk's inner edge plays a
pivotal role in destabilizing resonant chains by spreading planetary systems
outward, thereby triggering early dynamical instabilities and giant impacts.
Despite this dynamical evolution, key observable properties of close-in
planetary systems -- such as the distribution of orbital period ratio, the
intra-system similarity in planet sizes (``radius uniformity''), and the
bimodal distribution of planet radii known as the ``radius valley'' -- remain
largely consistent with those of systems formed without the rebound effect, in
which the inner edge of the disk remains fixed. Thus, the primary consequence
of the rebound appears to be the early disruption of resonant chains, rather
than any significant alteration to the statistical properties of the resulting
super-Earth and mini-Neptune populations.

### [9] [Particle dynamics in TOI-178 planetary system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07930)
*J. Boskovic,R. Sfair,C. M. Schäfer*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: TOI-178系统中五个行星处于拉普拉斯共振链，研究发现共振链内行星的共轨区域比经典理论预测宽30%，而链外的TOI-178b则宽52%。在TOI-178e和f之间发现了由平均运动共振形成的Kirkwood间隙结构，粒子清除发生在500年时间尺度上。最内区显示196年周期的倾角振荡，与TOI-178b自身振荡周期一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究TOI-178多行星系统的动力学特性，特别是共振链对测试粒子动力学的影响，为类似共振系统的比较研究提供基准特征。

Method: 使用N体模拟方法研究TOI-178系统中测试粒子的动力学行为，包括长期积分分析共振结构和粒子清除过程。

Result: 发现共振链内行星共轨区域宽度增加30%，链外行星增加52%；识别出TOI-178e和f之间的Kirkwood间隙结构；观测到最内区196年周期的倾角振荡，最大振幅出现在3:2共振位置附近。

Conclusion: TOI-178系统的共振架构产生了独特的动力学结构，这些发现为研究其他多行星共振系统的类似现象提供了重要的比较基准。

Abstract: The TOI-178 system hosts six planets with five of them locked in a :4:6:9:12
Laplace resonance chain. We perform N-body simulations to investigate the
dynamics of test particles in this system. We observe that co-orbital regions
around each planet are approximately 30\% wider than predicted by classical
theory for planets in the resonance chain, while TOI-178b, which lies outside
the chain, shows a 52\% enhancement. The region between TOI-178e and TOI-178f
reveals Kirkwood gap-like structures created by mean-motion resonances with
TOI-178f (4:3, 5:4, 6:5) and TOI-178g (5:3), where particle clearing occurs on
500-year timescales. An extended integration of the innermost region
(0.015-0.025 au) shows periodic inclination oscillations with period 196 years,
coincident with TOI-178b's own oscillation period, with maximum amplitude
occurring near the 3:2 resonance location. These structures are consistent with
the system's resonant architecture and provide a baseline characterization that
enables future comparative studies of similar phenomena in other multi-planet
systems with resonant configurations.

Conclusion: 耦合建模能够解释近距离外星球的形成和生存机制，为在"沙漠"边缘找到飞发性丰富的星球提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The observed architecture and modeled evolution of close-in exoplanets
provide crucial insights into their formation pathways and survival mechanisms.
To investigate these fundamental questions, we employed JADE, a comprehensive
numerical code that models the coupled evolution of atmospheres and dynamics
over secular timescales, rooted in present-day observations. JADE integrates
photoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles
from an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where
dynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically
considered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar
spin-orbit angle that has survived within the "hot Neptune desert" despite
ongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000
simulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian
inference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the
properties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results
suggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial
atmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout
its history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion
inducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80{\deg}
- 100{\deg} with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By
combining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we
identified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found
that it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a
useful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how
coupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets
and explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.
