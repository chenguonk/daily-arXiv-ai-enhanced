TL;DR: 论文综述了系外黄道尘盘（exozodis）的理论研究，探讨其起源、演化及对系外行星成像的影响，并指出其对行星宜居性的潜在意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系外黄道尘盘广泛存在于主序星周围，可能干扰类地行星的直接成像与表征，因此理解其起源和演化至关重要。

Method: 综述现有理论模型，分析尘埃输送机制、分布特征及其与行星系统的关联。

Result: 尘埃可能由外向内输送，其分布和组成影响观测；同时，尘埃可能为宜居带带来水和挥发物。

Conclusion: 系外黄道尘盘既是挑战（干扰观测），也是机遇（提供宜居条件）。

Abstract: Exozodiacal dust disks (exozodis) are populations of warm (~300K) or hot
(~1000K) dust, located in or interior to a star's habitable zone, detected
around ~25% of main-sequence stars as excess emission over the stellar
photosphere at mid- or near-infrared wavelengths. Often too plentiful to be
explained by an in-situ planetesimal belt, exozodi dust is usually thought to
be transported inwards from further out in the system. There is no consensus on
which (if any) of various proposed dynamical models is correct, yet it is vital
to understand exozodis given the risk they pose to direct imaging and
characterisation of Earth-like planets. This article reviews current
theoretical understanding of the origin and evolution of exozodi dust. It also
identifies key questions pertinent to the potential for exozodis to impact
exoplanet imaging and summarises current understanding of the answer to them
informed by exozodi theory. These address how exozodi dust is delivered, its
size and spatial distribution, and the effect of its composition on exozodi
observability, as well as the connection between hot and warm exozodis. Also
addressed are how common different exozodi levels are and how that level can be
predicted from system properties, as well as the features that planets impart
in dust distributions and how exozodis affect a planet's physical properties
and habitability. We conclude that exozodis present both a problem and an
opportunity, e.g., by introducing noise that makes planets harder to detect,
but also identifying systems in which ingredients conducive to life, like water
and volatiles, are delivered to the habitable zone.

TL;DR: JWST发现极低质量恒星周围行星形成盘中的多种分子，如C2H2、C6H6等，表明碳主导的化学环境。研究通过2D热化学盘模型解释观测数据，探讨高C/O比的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解极低质量恒星周围行星形成盘中碳主导化学的成因，并验证2D模型是否能解释观测到的分子柱密度和伪连续谱。

Method: 使用2D热化学盘模型PRODIMO和快速谱线追踪器FLiTs，分析分子发射特征，比较0D模型结果，探讨氧耗尽或碳富集的影响。

Result: 发现存在间隙的盘结构能最好解释观测数据，内盘区域小颗粒尘埃显著减少。

Conclusion: 2D模型成功解释了观测数据，支持碳富集是高C/O比的主要原因。

Abstract: JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very
low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these
species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of
$10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas
with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one
such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two
oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim
to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We
examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred
column densities of \ce{C2H2} in the inner regions of the disk and produce a
pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether
depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio
triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative
thermo-chemical disk model P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O} to identify a disk
structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of
species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is
generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature
$\langle T \rangle$, column density $\langle$ log$_{\rm {10}} N\rangle$ and the
emitting area $\langle r_{\rm{1}} - r_{\rm{2}} \rangle$ for these molecules
from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally
from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C
abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion
and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence
of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted
in dust, especially small grains ($<5\,\mu$m), and ..

TL;DR: 研究发现高压力高温下水-氨系统会形成富水氨水合物，包括新型超富水合物NH3.6H2O，这对系外行星冰幔的化学分层和热演化有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究水-氨系统在高压高温条件下的行为，以模拟系外行星冰幔的内部动力学。

Method: 通过实验观察AHH（氨半水合物）和冰VII在750 K和16 GPa以上的化学反应，分析形成的富水氨水合物及其稳定性。

Result: 发现富水氨水合物（如NH3.6H2O）在30 GPa和1600 K下稳定存在，并可在室温下淬火保存。

Conclusion: 富水氨水合物在系外行星冰幔中普遍存在，其与冰VII的密度差异可能导致化学分层，影响行星热演化。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the water-ammonia system at high pressure-high
temperature conditions is important for modeling the internal dynamics of
exoplanet icy mantles. Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1
ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate
solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical
reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize
water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate
NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and
excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and
can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich
ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets
regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion
and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast
between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in
exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution.

### [4] [Rings around giant planets and smaller bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11963)
*Keiji Ohtsuki*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 太阳系四大行星均有环，但特性各异。环由小颗粒组成，近行星区域因潮汐力无法合并形成环，远区域则形成卫星。环结构多样，引力与非引力作用影响不同。环起源理论多样，未来对系外行星环的探测将揭示其形成演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究行星环的形成机制及其多样性，为理解行星系统的演化提供线索。

Method: 分析行星环的物理特性、形成条件和观测数据，探讨引力与非引力作用的影响。

Result: 行星环的形成受潮汐力和引力作用影响，结构多样，起源机制可能不同。

Conclusion: 未来对系外行星环和小天体环的探测将有助于揭示行星系统的形成与演化。

Abstract: All the four giant planets in our Solar System have rings, but their
characteristics are very different. The rings consist of a number of small
particles, although individual particles have not been directly imaged. Near
the central planet, colliding particles bounce off each other in low-velocity
impacts but cannot gravitationally merge due to the effect of the tidal force,
resulting in the formation of rings, whereas in more distant regions particles
can gravitationally accrete to form satellites. Rings exhibit various types of
fine structure, and the mutual gravitational forces between particles and the
gravity from satellites play an important role in rings of macroscopic
particles, while non-gravitational forces are important for dusty rings. There
are several theories about the origin of rings, and formation mechanisms are
likely to be different among different ring systems. The rings of small Solar
System bodies were discovered through observations of occultations of stars by
these bodies. It is natural to expect that some exoplanets should also have
rings, but their detection remains challenging. Future discovery of more
ring-moon systems around small bodies and exoplanets will provide clues to
understanding the formation and evolution of the central bodies that host them.

### [5] [Destruction of "Peas in a Pod?" A Candidate Multi-planet System Around the Nearby, Bright Star, HD208487](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12447)

TL;DR: 重新研究HD208487系统，验证HD208487c的存在性，并利用新数据发现候选行星HD208487d，提出三行星系统的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证HD208487c的真实性，并探索系统中是否存在更多行星。

Method: 结合GLS周期图和贝叶斯分析（EMPEROR代码），检查恒星活动指数和光度数据。

Result: 发现候选行星HD208487c和HD208487d，提出三行星系统的动态演化模型。

Conclusion: HD208487可能是一个三行星系统，未来更多数据可能揭示第四颗行星的存在。

Abstract: We re-investigate the HD208487 system to test the reality of the proposed
HD208487c world. We also search for additional companions using applied
Bayesian statistics and 15+ years of new RV data from the HARPS and the PFS
instruments that were taken post-discovery of HD208487b.
  The RV data was analyzed with GLS Periodograms, followed by Bayesian analysis
using the EMPEROR code. We scrutinised various stellar activity indices to
search for any corresponding peaks in the power spectra, correlations with the
RV measurements, or significant signals from a Bayesian analysis methodology.
Finally, photometric data was checked to test for any transits or possible
activity manifestations that could lead to possible false RV signals or excess
noise.
  Our analysis points towards a candidate second planet in the system,
positioned near the period of a previously proposed and subsequently challenged
signal. This signal, HD208487c, would relate to a cool Saturn with an orbital
period of 923.06 +2.02 -2.76 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.32 +/- 0.01Mj.
Our analysis also gives rise to a newly discovered candidate planet, HD208487d,
which would be the result of a cool super-Neptune/sub-Saturn with a period of
1380.13 +19.20 -8.25 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.15 +/- 0.01Mj. Neither
stellar activity indices nor photometric data show signals statistically
matching these periods.
  We have uncovered a candidate three planet system that would consist of an
inner gas giant, a central Saturn and an outer super-Neptune/sub-Saturn. A
dynamical analysis suggests that gravitational scattering of an initially
ordered, equally-spaced system in a long resonant chain of six Neptunes can
explain the current proposed architecture of HD208487. More RVs may also shed
light on the reality of a fourth Doppler signal uncovered in the data that sits
close to the 2:1 period-ratio with signal of HD208487c.

### [6] [The JWST Rocky Worlds DDT Program reveals GJ 3929b to likely be a bare rock](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12516)

TL;DR: JWST观测GJ 3929b的二次日食，结合TESS和MAROON-X数据，发现其日面亮度温度与裸岩石一致，排除了厚CO2大气层，并发现系统中还有两颗非凌日行星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GJ 3929b的大气特性和系统内其他行星的存在。

Method: 使用JWST MIRI成像、TESS数据和MAROON-X光谱仪进行观测和分析。

Result: GJ 3929b的日面温度与裸岩石一致，排除了厚CO2大气层；发现两颗非凌日行星。

Conclusion: GJ 3929b可能失去了显著的大气层，系统内还有其他行星存在。

Abstract: We report first results from the JWST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary
Time program. Two secondary eclipses of the terrestrial exoplanet GJ 3929b were
recently observed using MIRI photometric imaging at 15 um. We present a
reduction of these data using the updated SPARTA pipeline. We also refine the
planet mass, radius, and predicted time of secondary eclipse using a new sector
of TESS data and new, high-precision radial velocities from the MAROON-X
spectrograph. For the two JWST observations, we recover secondary eclipse
depths of 177+47-45ppm and 143+34-35ppm at times consistent with a nearly
circular orbit, as expected from the radial velocity data. A joint fit of the
two visits yields a dayside brightness temperature Tp,dayside = 782+/-79K for
GJ 3929b, which is consistent with the maximum brightness temperature Tmax =
737+/-14K for a bare, black rock (i.e., assuming zero Bond albedo and no heat
redistribution). These results rule out CO2-rich atmospheres thicker than
100mbar at >3sigma, suggesting that GJ 3929b has lost any significant secondary
atmosphere. The radial velocity data also indicate two additional
non-transiting planets in the system: a previously-identified planet in a 15.0d
orbit, and a newly-identified planet candidate in a 6.1d orbit.

### [7] [Energy relaxation in superthermal collisions of carbon with oxygen: the influence of isotopic substitution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12807)
*Cheikh T. Bop,Marko Gacesa*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文研究了火星大气中碳逃逸的精确建模，发现氧原子不能作为碳逃逸的替代模型，且同位素组合对逃逸模型有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星大气从稠密到稀薄的转变涉及大量碳的损失，需精确建模碳逃逸过程，但现有模型未充分考虑碳与氧的碰撞差异。

Method: 计算了C($^3$P) + O($^3$P)系统的精确势能曲线，并推导了统计平均的弹性及微分截面，对比了氧原子碰撞数据。

Result: 发现碳与氧的碰撞截面差异可达两倍，且同位素组合导致截面变化达8%，对逃逸模型有显著影响。

Conclusion: 氧原子不能替代碳逃逸模型，同位素效应需纳入火星大气演化解释。

Abstract: The transition from a once-dense Martian atmosphere to the thin one observed
today implies a substantial loss of carbon, either through atmospheric escape
or surface deposition. Accurately modeling this carbon escape necessitates
accounting for collisions between energetic carbon atoms and the primary
atmospheric constituents, including oxygen. To this end, we computed a highly
accurate and comprehensive set of potential energy curves (PECs) for the
C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) system. Based on these PECs, we derived statistically
averaged total elastic and differential cross sections. Comparison with
literature data for O($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions reveals that cross sections
involving carbon can differ by up to a factor of two, indicating that oxygen is
not a good proxy for modeling carbon escape. Furthermore, we evaluated the
impact of all possible isotopic combinations in C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions
and found variations in cross sections of up to 8\%. Given the observed
isotopic enrichment of carbon and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere, even such
moderate differences can have a significant effect on escape models and the
interpretation of planetary evolution.

### [8] [An empirical determination of the Cosmic Shoreline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12865)
*Pedro Meni-Gallardo,Enric Pallé*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文通过经验方法改进了宇宙海岸线概念，利用ExoAtmospheres数据库数据，重新定义了大气保留与逃逸的关系，并应用于M矮星周围的行星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为JWST和未来ELT观测提供更准确的小型系外行星大气分类工具。

Method: 使用ExoAtmospheres数据库中的最大样本，结合火星和55 Cnc e的数据，定义经验宇宙海岸线（ECS）。

Result: ECS斜率显著更陡，M矮星周围的行星大气保留比例高于经典模型预测，但低质量M矮星的行星大气易受XUV辐射影响。

Conclusion: ECS为JWST和ELT观测提供了高优先级目标，未来需进一步验证ECS，特别是边界候选行星和XUV历史明确的系统。

Abstract: The Cosmic Shoreline concept was introduced as a way to separate planets with
and without atmosphere, based on the relationship between the cumulative
instellation and the escape velocity observed in the Solar System. The
exoplanet community has tried to refine the way we understand the cosmic
shoreline in order to provide a consistent tool for establishing the hierarchy
for exoplanet observations. This is particularly relevant when trying to unveil
small exoplanet atmospheres with the JWST or the upcoming ELTs. Here, our goal
is to use an empirical approach to refine the Cosmic Shoreline concept. In
particular, we used the data provided by the ExoAtmospheres database, using the
largest available sample of exoplanets with confirmed atmospheric detections.
We reconcile limitations in the classical shoreline definition by anchoring our
Empirical Cosmic Shoreline (ECS) to both Mars and the irradiated super-Earth 55
Cnc e. The resulting relation exhibits a significantly steeper slope than
previously theorized. Applied to planets orbiting M dwarfs, prime targets for
habitable-zone studies, the ECS suggests that a larger fraction retain
atmospheres than predicted by classical models when using standard Ixuv
estimates. However, incorporating revised XUV fluence histories for low-mass M
dwarfs (M< 0.35 Ms) reveals severe atmospheric vulnerability: only seven small
planets (R<1.7 Re) orbit securely within the retention zone of these stars. We
finally identify high-priority targets for the JWST Rocky Worlds survey and
future ELT observations based on their ECS positioning and Transmission
Spectroscopy Metrics. Future efforts must focus on expanding the empirical
validations of the ECS, particularly through high-precision observations of
borderline candidates and systems with well-constrained XUV histories.

### [9] [TIRAMISU: Non-LTE radiative transfer for molecules in exoplanet atmospheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12873)
*Charles A. Bowesman,Sergei N. Yurchenko,Ahmed Al-Refaie,Jonathan Tennyson*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: TIRAMISU是一种新程序，用于计算非局部热平衡（非LTE）分子光谱和透明度，以解决系外行星大气中的自洽辐射传输问题。以超热木星KELT-20 b为例，研究非LTE效应可检测的波长区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非LTE效应对系外行星大气光谱和透明度的影响，以改进大气和化学模型。

Method: 使用TIRAMISU程序计算非LTE分子光谱和透明度，并以KELT-20 b为例分析非LTE效应的可观测性。

Result: 发现非LTE条件下OH的振动状态在红外和可见光波段有显著影响，光解速率可增加两个数量级，且分子透明度变化可能导致分子丰度误判。

Conclusion: 非LTE效应对系外行星大气模型有重要影响，未来需更多碰撞数据支持非LTE建模。

Abstract: The TIRAMISU code, a new program for computing on-the-fly non-LTE molecular
spectra and opacities for solving self-consistent radiative transfer problems
in exoplanet atmospheres, is presented. The ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20 b is used
as a case study to identify the wavelength regions at which non-LTE effects may
be detectable. It is shown that upper atmospheric OH in vibrational non-LTE
should be observable primarily via hot bands in the mid-infrared and enhanced
photodissociation in the visible. Varying the abundance of OH in non-LTE
demonstrates a non-linear relationship between the abundance and the strength
of non-LTE effects. Using recent calculations of the photodissociation
probabilities of OH it is shown that non-LTE effects can increase the total
photodissociation rate by two orders of magnitude in the upper atmosphere,
which is likely to have a significant impact on atmospheric and chemical
modelling. Increases and reductions in the molecular opacities under non-LTE
conditions may lead to the mischaracterisation of molecular abundances in
retrievals that only consider opacities computed under LTE. Collisional data
requirements to support future non-LTE modelling for a variety of exoplanet
atmospheres and across a wide range of wavelengths are discussed.

TL;DR: 传统多普勒成像（DI）技术可用于太阳类恒星活动建模和低质量行星搜索，但需改进以成为可靠的行星探测替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证传统DI技术是否适用于太阳类恒星活动建模及低质量行星搜索。

Method: 利用HARPS-N收集的太阳径向速度（RV）数据，通过DI技术反演表面亮度分布。

Result: DI生成的亮度图与低分辨率多普勒图匹配良好，RV残差为0.6 m/s，适用于轨道周期>100天的行星搜索。

Conclusion: 传统DI技术有潜力，但需解决局限性以替代现有行星搜索技术。

Abstract: Doppler Imaging (DI) is a well-established technique to map a physical field
at a stellar surface from a time series of high-resolution spectra. In this
proof-of-concept study, we aim to show that traditional DI algorithms,
originally designed for rapidly-rotating stars, have also the ability to model
the activity of Sun-like stars, when observed with new-generation highly-stable
spectrographs, and search for low-mass planets around them. We used DI to
retrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from
radial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024.
The brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about
36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of
the Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV
residuals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable
with existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet
injection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind
planet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3
to 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates
with an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process
regression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI
algorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to
state-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.

TL;DR: 研究分析了白矮星碎片盘的多时期红外光变数据，发现85%的盘存在显著变异性，且变异性与盘亮度、气体存在相关，支持碰撞产生尘埃和气体的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索白矮星碎片盘的动态行为及其物理机制，挑战传统薄盘模型的预测。

Method: 利用Spitzer太空望远镜的多时期3.6和4.5微米光度观测数据，包括16个系统的周观测和5个系统的5小时凝视模式观测。

Result: 85%的盘在分钟到年的时间尺度上表现出显著变异性，亮度和颜色变化相关，支持碰撞产生小尘埃颗粒的模型。

Conclusion: 数据支持碰撞演化模型，为未来白矮星碎片盘研究提供了重要资源，并挑战了传统薄盘框架。

Abstract: This study presents all available, multi-epoch 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry
from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of white dwarf debris disks,
including weekly cadence observations of 16 relatively bright systems, and 5 h
staring-mode observations for five of these. Significant variability is
detected in 85 per cent of disks and across all timescales probed, from minutes
to weeks to years, where the largest flux changes correlate with the longest
time baselines, and the infrared excesses persist utterly. While each source is
idiosyncratic, the overall results indicate the most variable disks correlate
with those that are the brightest (dustiest), and also among those with
detected gas, demonstrating both dust and gas are produced via ongoing
collisions. There is a correlation between flux and colour changes, where disks
tend to appear redder when dimmer and bluer when brighter, consistent with an
excess of small dust grains produced in collisions, followed by a gradual
return to equilibrium. The overall results are a drastic departure from the
predictions of the canonical - geometrically thin, optically thick - disk in
both flux and colour, but are broadly consistent with collisional evolution
based on a simple model. The data presented herein constitute a legacy resource
that can inform time-series studies of polluted and dusty white dwarfs, and
importantly serve as a basis for future disk modelling, beyond the pioneering
canonical framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现早期M矮星周围的热木星（HJs）比AFGK恒星周围少2-3倍，表明HJs可能通过不同路径形成或迁移。通过Rossiter-McLaughlin效应测量TOI-3714 b和TOI-5293 A b的宿主恒星倾角，发现两者均对齐良好，支持M矮星通过深对流层有效阻尼倾斜的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨热木星在不同类型恒星周围的形成和迁移机制差异，尤其是早期M矮星与AFGK恒星的对比。

Method: 使用Gemini-North/MAROON-X光谱仪测量TOI-3714 b和TOI-5293 A b的Rossiter-McLaughlin效应，分析恒星倾角，并结合Gaia DR3天体测量数据约束双星轨道。

Result: TOI-3714和TOI-5293 A的恒星倾角均对齐良好，分别为λ=21°和-12°。TOI-5293系统的行星与双星伴星的最小相互倾角足以驱动Kozai-Lidov迁移。

Conclusion: M矮星通过深对流层有效阻尼倾斜，导致其周围的热木星宿主恒星对齐良好，支持Kozai-Lidov迁移在早期M矮星周围更高效的假设。

Abstract: Hot Jupiters (HJs) are $2-3\times$ less common around early M dwarfs than
around AFGK stars, suggesting that HJs may form and/or migrate via distinct
pathways around different types of stars. One source of insight into HJ
formation mechanisms is to trace their dynamical histories through measurements
of host stellar obliquities via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Here we
present measurements of the RM effect for the HJs TOI-3714 b and TOI-5293 A b
using the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. Our measurements represent just
the second and third hot Jupiters around M dwarfs (HJMD) with a detection of
the RM effect. We find that both systems are well-aligned with sky-projected
obliquities of $\lambda = 21^{+14}_{-11}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ and
$-12^{+19}_{-14}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ and deprojected obliquities of $\psi =
26^{+11}_{-10}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ and $24^{+11}_{-10}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ for
TOI-3714 and TOI-5293 A, respectively. Both stars are in wide binary systems.
We refine the stellar parameters by decontaminating their unresolved $K_s$-band
photometry and constrain the binary orbits using Gaia DR3 astrometry. We find
that the minimum mutual inclination of the planet and binary companion in the
TOI-5293 system is sufficiently large to drive Kozai-Lidov (KL) migration while
the result for TOI-3714 is inconclusive. We present a population-level analysis
of HJs around AFGK versus early M dwarfs and argue that KL migration is more
efficient around the latter, which is expected to produce misaligned stellar
obliquities in HJMD systems in the absence of efficient tidal damping. The
emerging population of well-aligned HJMD hosts supports the expectation that M
dwarfs, with their deep convective envelopes, do efficiently dampen misaligned
obliquities.
