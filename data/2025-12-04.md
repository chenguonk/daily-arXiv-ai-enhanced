  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过SPHERE多项目观测，系统分析碎片盘的形态、尘埃质量和颗粒特性随恒星参数的变化趋势，探索盘结构与潜在行星的关系。

Method: 使用SPHERE光学和近红外观测161颗年轻恒星；通过椭圆拟合和模型网格推导盘几何结构；采用修正黑体模型和尺寸分布模型分析SED以约束尘埃质量和性质；进行动力学建模评估观测结构是否可由未探测行星解释。

Result: 解析了51个碎片盘，包括4个新发现；在HD 114082系统中发现第二个凌日巨行星；识别9个多带系统，内外带半径比1.5-2；盘半径与恒星光度呈弱相关，但在CO和CO₂冻结区依赖性更强；尘埃光度随年龄衰减；尘埃质量与盘半径和恒星质量呈超线性关系。

Conclusion: 研究系统表征了碎片盘特性，揭示了盘半径、尘埃质量和演化与恒星参数的定量关系，为理解碎片盘形成和演化提供了重要观测约束，并建立了估算尘埃反照率和最大偏振分数的新参数方法。

Abstract: This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of ~1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\rm belt} \propto L_{\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\,M_\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\,M_\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\rm belt}^n$ with $n>2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of ~1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.

TL;DR: 模拟20个附近碎片盘恒星的抛射物质轨迹，发现这些星际物质已进入太阳系，估计有约2个宏观星际天体在太阳系内，但探测难度较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究附近碎片盘恒星抛射的物质如何进入太阳系，量化它们对星际物质种群的贡献，为探测星际物质提供天体物理起源框架。

Method: 在模拟的银河系势场中建模20个附近碎片盘恒星（包括Epsilon Eridani、Vega、Fomalhaut、Beta Pictoris等）的抛射物质轨迹，计算宏观星际天体（≥100米）和较小流星体（≥200微米）的预期通量。

Result: 模拟显示这20个系统的物质目前已在太阳系内，估计有约2个宏观星际天体在太阳系内（仅占预期总数的一小部分），但Rubin望远镜可能发现它们；来自这些系统的流星体也存在，但现有探测方法可能需要数十年才能收集到单个事件。

Conclusion: 这些结果为将星际物质探测与其天体物理起源联系起来提供了框架，为探测附近行星系统的组成和动力学历史提供了新机会，但样本中的粒子相对速度较低，可能使观测区分更加困难。

Abstract: We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.

TL;DR: 重新评估陨石数据，早期太阳活动水平Φ≈3×10³，而非之前认为的极高值，表明早期太阳活动与典型原恒星一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束早期太阳活动水平Φ对理解原行星盘电离、磁旋转不稳定性等过程至关重要。近期陨石数据解释暗示Φ值极高（>10⁵），使年轻太阳异常活跃，需要重新检验这些数据

Method: 重新检验陨石数据：宇宙成因Ne在盘内产生；³⁶Cl在盘消散后产生；¹⁰Be继承自分子云而非盘内产生；否定⁷Be存在的证据

Result: 数据与Φ≈3×10³一致，表明早期太阳X射线和高能粒子通量与典型原恒星相当，而非异常活跃

Conclusion: 早期太阳活动水平Φ≈3×10³，与天文观测的原恒星通量一致，否定了之前提出的极高活动水平假设

Abstract: Solar flares emit X rays and high-energy (MeV-GeV) ions (Solar Energetic Particles, or SEPs). Astronomical observations show solar mass-protostellar fluxes are a factor $Φ\approx 3 \times 10^2 - 3 \times 10^3$ times higher than the present-day Sun. Constraining $Φ$ in the early solar system is important for modeling ionization in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, the extent of magnetorotational instability or magnetocentrifugal outflows, or even production of short-lived radionuclides. Recent interpretations of meteoritic data -- cosmogenic Ne in hibonite grains, initial $({}^{10}{\rm Be}/{}^{9}{\rm Be})_0$ ratios in Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), or even inferences of live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs -- have suggested values $Φ> 10^5$, even as large as $Φ\approx 6 \times 10^6$, which would make the young Sun extraordinarily active, even for a protostar. We constrain $Φ$ by re-examining these data. We conclude: cosmogenic Ne was produced in hibonite grains as they resided in the disk; ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$ was created in Cl-poor grains after the disk dissipated; ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ was inherited from the molecular cloud, with almost no ($< 1\%$) ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ created in the disk; and there is no evidence whatsoever for any live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs. We show these data are consistent with a value $Φ\approx 3 \times 10^3$ for the first $> 5$ Myr of the solar nebula. The early Sun evidently emitted a flux of X rays and SEPs not atypical for a protostar.

### [4] [Interferometric Detection and Orbit Modeling of the Subcomponent in the Hot-dust System $κ$ Tuc A: A Low-mass Star on an Eccentric Orbit in a Hierarchical-quintuple System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03209)

TL;DR: 利用MATISSE和GRAVITY干涉仪观测κ Tuc A系统，首次探测到其伴星κ Tuc Ab，获得完整轨道解，发现其高偏心轨道与热系外黄道尘的关联


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: κ Tuc A系统是研究热系外黄道尘的重要目标，因为已探测到近红外超量的时间变化。需要确认系统中是否存在先前通过天体测量推断的伴星，并理解其与热系外黄道尘检测的关系。

Method: 使用甚大望远镜干涉仪(VLTI)的MATISSE中红外光谱实验和GRAVITY仪器进行观测。通过MATISSE的闭合相位分析探测伴星，利用GRAVITY验证天体测量精度，结合多时期观测数据获得完整轨道解。

Result: 成功探测到κ Tuc Ab伴星，其L波段流量比主星为1.32%，是MATISSE闭合相位探测到的最高对比度伴星。获得其轨道参数：偏心率为0.94，半长轴为4.8au。估计其光谱类型为M3.5V到M4.5V。发现该伴星可能解释了2012和2014年的热系外黄道尘检测，但无法解释2019年的检测。

Conclusion: 首次直接探测到κ Tuc Ab伴星并确定其轨道特性，揭示了该系统复杂的架构。低质量恒星在高偏心轨道上的存在、热系外黄道尘以及可能的星子库之间的相互作用值得进一步研究。

Abstract: The system $κ$ Tuc A is part of a hierarchical-quintuple system and is a prime target for studies of hot-exozodiacal dust, because a time-variable near-infrared excess has been detected. We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $κ$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $κ$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2°, which makes $κ$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $κ$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $κ$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $κ$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $κ$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $κ$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $κ$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $κ$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.

TL;DR: 开发corosims工具模拟罗马望远镜日冕仪观测，分析抖动误差与系外黄道尘盘结构的混淆效应，评估仪器对尘埃盘的探测灵敏度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马空间望远镜的日冕仪将为未来宜居世界观测站奠定技术基础，但其性能受多种因素影响，特别是抖动误差可能影响系外黄道尘盘的探测，需要系统评估这些混淆效应

Method: 开发corosims工具，包装PROPER衍射模型和探测器模拟器，模拟不同抖动条件下的天体场景观测，特别分析抖动引起的斑点与热/暖系外黄道尘盘结构的混淆

Result: 在名义抖动性能下，日冕仪可探测12倍黄道尘盘量的尘埃；抖动恶化3倍时灵敏度降至35倍；抖动会阻碍暖尘盘探测但不太可能导致假阳性；小分离角处的微弱热尘盘可能与抖动斑点混淆

Conclusion: 抖动误差会影响罗马日冕仪对系外黄道尘盘的探测灵敏度，特别是在小分离角区域，需要仔细考虑这些混淆效应以确保科学观测的可靠性

Abstract: The Coronagraph Instrument on board of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate key technologies that will prepare the ground for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. The current predictions for the Roman Coronagraph's detection limit range from 1e-8 to a few 1e-9, which would allow for groundbreaking science, such as potentially imaging Jupiter-like planets. However, the performance of the instrument depends on many factors. Simulating images with varying optical error sources can help us connect instrument and observatory performance to science yield. Here we present corosims, a tool to simulate observations of astrophysical scenes with the Coronagraph with evolving errors. This tool wraps around the Coronagraph PROPER diffraction model and detector simulator. We use it to investigate the potential degeneracy between jitter-induced speckles and both hot and warm exozodi disk structures. First, we simulate observations of exozodi around Tau Ceti, with varying jitter. We predict that with nominal post-correction pointing jitter performance (~0.3 mas RMS), the Roman Coronagraph should be sensitive to 12x zodis worth of dust, assuming a face-on (worst case scenario) inclination. We further predict that its sensitivity degrades to 35x zodis if jitter on-target is 3x worse than the nominal value. This estimate assumes the best-modeled wavefront control and stability values from the project, including additional model uncertainty factors. We find that, while jitter hinders warm exozodi detection, jitter residuals are unlikely to result in a false positive. However, if a faint hot exozodi falls at small separation, it may not be distinguishable from jitter-induced speckle residuals of comparable brightness. Finally, we discuss the degeneracies induced between flux and separation retrieved near the inner working angle due the sharp edge of the Roman Coronagraph's focal plane mask.

TL;DR: LSST将发现130-300个海王星特洛伊天体，其中60%具有高质量颜色光变数据，样本量比现有数据增加4倍以上，显著提升对海王星特洛伊天体颜色和大小分布的统计分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海王星特洛伊天体是太阳系中研究不足的1:1共振天体，被认为是从原行星盘捕获的动态热天体。LSST巡天将极大扩展对这类天体的发现和表征能力，但目前缺乏对其发现潜力的预测。

Method: 使用Sorcha巡天模拟器结合最新的LSST观测策略模拟，预测LSST将发现的海王星特洛伊天体数量和质量。特别考虑了不同观测区域（L4和L5云）的观测频率差异。

Result: 预测LSST将发现中位数约130-300个海王星特洛伊天体，存在2:1的探测偏向性（L5云比L4云多）。约60%的发现天体将满足严格的颜色光变质量标准，样本量比现有数据增加4倍以上。

Conclusion: LSST将显著提升对海王星特洛伊天体的表征能力，提供高质量的颜色测量数据，支持对其起源和与更广泛跨海王星天体关系的统计分析，并为未来的光谱观测提供目标。

Abstract: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), beginning full operations in late 2025, will dramatically transform solar system science by vastly expanding discoveries and providing detailed characterization opportunities across all small body populations. This includes the co-orbiting 1:1 resonant Neptune Trojans, which are thought to be dynamically hot captures from the protoplanetary disk. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, combined with the latest LSST cadence simulations, we present the very first predictions for the Neptune Trojan yield within the LSST. We forecast a model-dependent median number of $\sim130-300$ discovered Neptune Trojans, and infer a notable 2:1 detection bias toward the recently emerged L5 cloud near the galactic plane versus the L4 cloud, reflecting the lower-cadence coverage in the Northern Ecliptic Spur region that suppresses L4 detections. The additionally simulated Science Validation survey will offer the very first early insights into this understudied cloud. Around 60\% of detected main survey Neptune Trojans will meet stringent color light curve quality criteria, increasing the sample size more than fourfold compared to existing datasets. This enhanced sample will enable robust statistical analyses of Neptune Trojan color and size distributions, crucial for understanding their origins and relationship to the broader trans-Neptunian population. These comprehensive color measurements represent a major step forward in characterizing the Neptune Trojan population and will facilitate future targeted spectroscopic observations.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 双星系统中的凌星行星非常罕见，尤其是在周期≤7天的紧密双星周围完全缺失。本文发现一种共振机制可以解释这一现象：当双星相对论进动与行星牛顿进动匹配时，行星会被共振捕获并最终被驱逐或吞噬。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么在紧密双星系统（周期≤7天）中观测不到凌星行星，探索这种缺失背后的物理机制。

Method: 利用长期共振理论，研究当双星相对论进动与行星牛顿进动匹配时的共振捕获机制。通过轨道平均模拟分析行星与双星的动力学相互作用。

Result: 在收缩的双星系统中：80%的行星会遭遇并被共振捕获；75%的行星会被"摧毁"（驱逐或吞噬）；幸存者则处于遥远、低凌星概率的轨道上。

Conclusion: 紧密双星形成的过程本身就会清除其周围可能存在的凌星行星，这解释了观测到的凌星行星缺失现象。

Abstract: Transiting circumbinary planets (CBPs) are conspicuously rare, and entirely absent around stellar binaries with periods $\leq 7$ days. Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside.

TL;DR: 木星原始结构研究表明其具有温暖、富含金属的稀释核心，原始半径约1.89倍木星半径，为理解其形成过程提供新约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 木星的原始结构对理解其形成和早期演化至关重要，但至今仍不确定。利用木星内卫星的动力学约束结合热演化模拟，可以确定哪些原始结构与现今木星一致，从而为形成时期的内部建模提供锚点。

Method: 结合木星内卫星的动力学约束与热演化模拟，构建了4,250个行星结构演化模型，包括成分混合和氦相分离，覆盖广泛的初始熵和成分分布范围。

Result: 木星现今结构最佳解释为温暖（4.98±3.00 k_B m_u^{-1}）、富含金属的稀释核心。为同时满足木星原始自转约束，其包层在盘消散时温度更高（9.32±0.48 k_B m_u^{-1}）。确定木星原始半径为1.89±0.40 R_J。

Conclusion: 这些结果为木星形成提供新约束：大部分重元素在气体快速吸积早期就已吸积，并为吸积激波期间耗散的能量设定了界限。

Abstract: The primordial structure of Jupiter remains uncertain, yet it holds vital clues on the planet's formation and early evolution. Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\, \mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.
