However, their stability and breakdown\nmechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and\nnonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using\nFloquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis\ngeneralizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation\nwavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber\norientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave\nfrequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations\nhave wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low\nwave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use\ndirect numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and\nexamine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or\naccumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the\nconversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave\namplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant\ntriadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases\nwith decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient\ncoupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability\nand breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for\nunderstanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport\nproperties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more\ncomplex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the Solar\nnebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt are suggested to be the\ndirect products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary\nbodies in the outer Solar System and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key\nconstraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift\nand coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion,\nplanet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal\nphotoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple\nclasses of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation\nand remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group and a\ndynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by\nboth dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid\ndispersal of the disk towards the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a\nparameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the\noutcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal\nformation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet\nformation, this model provides a promising pathway towards an outer Solar\nSystem formation model."}

Ground-based data were collected in the 2020-2024 time\nspan with the 0.6 m telescope (ADYU60) located at the Adiyaman University\nApplication and Research Center (Adiyaman, T\\\"{u}rkiye) and the 1.0 m telescope\nat the T\\\"{u}rkiye National Observatory (TUG, T\\\"{u}rkiye). Through a\ncombination of fits to our ground-based data, the mid-transit times data from\nTESS and additional data taken from the literature, we present an updated\nlinear ephemeris for each system. Transit timing variations (TTVs) were\nanalyzed using linear, orbital decay, and apsidal precession models. The\nresulting BIC($\\Delta$BIC) values indicate that the orbital decay model is\nstatistically favored for HAT-P-16b and TOI-1516b, while the constant period\nmodel is preferred for TOI-2046b. False alarm probabilities (FAPs) were\ncomputed to assess the significance of any periodic signals. TOI-1516b displays\na strong TTV signal with a FAP (of 0.0001) well below the 0.01 threshold,\nsuggesting a likely dynamical origin that warrants further investigation. The\nhigher FAP value (0.0055) for HAT-P-16b suggests that the case of a possible\npresence of an additional body in the system is less convincing.

Supplementary Data available on Zenodo", "summary": "With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot\nJupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported\nfor WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger\ntransit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than\nthe morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences,\nphoto/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To\ninterpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of\nhow the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in\nforward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from\nfive different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating\ndisequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the\nrecent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the\ntemperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one\nsimulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted\nby the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent\nin their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several\nequilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the\nmorning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium\nprocesses, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features\ndisappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models\nstill cannot reproduce the observed ${\\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$\nfeature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored\nparameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need\nfor future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader\nparameter space."}

These outputs affected magnetospheric environments\nof early Earth and young rocky exoplanets. The interaction of the fast solar\nwind with the slow wind produced strong shocks from Corotating Interaction\nRegions (CIRs) that provided high dynamic pressure on the magnetospheres of\nearly Venus, Earth, and Mars. Here, we apply the Space Weather Modeling\nFramework (SWMF), coupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the\nresponse of the magnetospheric environments and associated Joule heating\ndeposited in the upper atmosphere of early Earth as it passed through a CIR\nshock from the young Sun.

The magnetic storm\nproduces dawn-dusk asymmetries in the polar cap boundary arising from the\nstellar magnetic field By. The proton density enhancements during the CIR event\nare the dominant factor in the overall dynamic pressure for resulting electron\nprecipitation and Joule heating deposited into the Earth's ionosphere.

Here, we propose that pit craters are stratigraphically on top of\nthe ice-related landforms and present complex relationships with the gullies.\nThe spatial relationship between the pits and these structures, along with the\nabsence of evidence of present or past volcanic activity and the lack of\nevidence of any extensional faulting allows us to propose that the origin of\nthe pit craters in the study area might be related to some volatile process. We\npropose here that these particular pit craters at Hale crater, are\nmorphologically similar to Icelandic depressions located in a glacial\nenvironment. We conclude that the landforms found in the area are in close\nrelation with glacial or periglacial conditions and pit craters might be formed\nby sublimation/melting of ground ice."}

Technologically advanced civilizations may tackle this issue\nby installing artificial structures -- starshades -- which can reduce the\nradiation received by the planet. Starshades, if they exist, are potentially\ndetectable with current or near-future technology. We have simulated phase\ncurve signatures in direct imaging of hypothetical starshades in systems\ntargeted by the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will be\ntasked with searching for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The\nstarshade is assumed to be a circular, reflecting surface placed at the inner\nLagrange point between the star and the planet. Our results show that the phase\ncurve of a starshade has a distinct shape compared to that of a typical planet.\nThe phase curve signature lies above the expected $1\\sigma=10^{-11}$\nsingle-visit precision in contrast ratio of the telescope for 70.8% of the\ntarget stars for the expected inner working angle (IWA) of around 60 mas.
