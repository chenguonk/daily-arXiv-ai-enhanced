Enhancing neural network mitigation of stellar activity RV signals with additional metrics", "comment": "31 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables. Accepted for publication in AJ", "summary": "The measurement of exoplanet masses using the radial velocity (RV) technique is currently limited by stellar activity, which introduces quasiperiodic variability signals that must be modeled and removed to enhance the sensitivity of the RV measurements to exoplanet signals. Neural networks have previously been demonstrated effective in modeling stellar activity signals in HARPS-N solar data using white light cross correlation functions (CCFs). Building on this work, we train a neural network on six years of HARPS-N solar data with additional parameters commonly associated to stellar activity, including chromatic CCFs, line shape metrics, spectral activity indicators, total solar irradiance (TSI) light curves from SORCE and TSIS-1, and TSI time derivatives. Our results show that parameters such as the bisector inverse slope and Na D equivalent widths do not significantly improve the neural network's ability to predict activity-induced RV variations compared to using the white light CCFs alone. However, parameters such as unsigned magnetic flux, the TSI and its time derivative, S-index, H-alpha equivalent width, chromatic CCFs, contrast, and full width at half maximum do improve the neural network's ability to predict RV scatter. Our new model reduces the RV scatter in a held-out test set from 147.1 cm/s to 93.3 cm/s, consistent with supergranulation noise levels reported in previous studies. These results suggest that finding effective tracers for (super)granulation will be critical to train models capable of further mitigating RV jitter, and necessary for characterizing Earth analogues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8272\u6563CCF\u3001\u8c31\u7ebf\u5f62\u72b6\u6307\u6807\u3001\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684RV\u6563\u5c04\u4ece147.1 cm/s\u964d\u4f4e\u523093.3 cm/s\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u8d85\u7c73\u7c92\u7ec4\u7ec7\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516d\u5e74HARPS-N\u592a\u9633\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\uff1a\u8272\u6563CCF\u3001\u8c31\u7ebf\u5f62\u72b6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u6781\u53cd\u659c\u7387\uff09\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u6d3b\u52a8\u6307\u6807\uff08S-index\u3001H-alpha\u7b49\uff09\u3001\u603b\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\uff08TSI\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u3001\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u6781\u53cd\u659c\u7387\u548cNa D\u7b49\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u767d\u5149CCF\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u3001TSI\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u3001S-index\u3001H-alpha\u7b49\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u8272\u6563CCF\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u534a\u9ad8\u5168\u5bbd\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4bRV\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684RV\u6563\u5c04\u4ece147.1 cm/s\u964d\u4f4e\u523093.3 cm/s\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff08\u8d85\uff09\u7c73\u7c92\u7ec4\u7ec7\u793a\u8e2a\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u8f7bRV\u6296\u52a8\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u7c7b\u5730\u884c\u661f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

KPIC's single-mode fiber feed reduces the $L$ band sky background by a factor of 100, significantly improving sensitivity compared to a seeing-limited spectrometer and enabling a tentative ($\\rm SNR = 3-4$) cross-correlation detection of GJ 436 b with a thermally inverted atmospheric model. In contrast with recent results from $JWST$ and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, our retrieval analysis prefers the presence of H$_2$O, and possibly CH$_4$, molecular features in emission. The broad-band continuum flux associated with the maximum-likelihood model is substantially higher than expected based on both the $\\sim670\\rm\\ K$ equilibrium temperature of GJ 436 b and previous results from low-resolution spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the loss of continuum information during the processing of high-resolution spectra makes our analysis effectively insensitive to the absolute continuum level of the planet, and that scaling the maximum-likelihood model to match the broad-band flux measured from low-resolution observations of GJ 436 b results in a detection of similar strength in cross-correlation. These results could be explained by a thermal inversion arising above a haze layer in the upper atmosphere of \\gjb. Further observations, ideally post-eclipse in order to break the $K_p - \u0394v_{sys}$ degeneracy, are needed to clarify this possible detection.

In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time.

These effects may be most pronounced in ultra-hot Jupiters that sustain global magnetic fields. WASP-18 b hosts an ionized dayside atmosphere extending deep enough to be strongly influenced by magnetic forces. Phase curve observations suggest effective magnetic drag, yet its impact on the atmospheric circulation remains poorly constrained. This work explores how magnetic drag in an inhomogeneously ionized atmosphere shapes local and global dynamics to provide a pathway to constrain the planet's magnetic field strength. An analytical parameterization for anisotropic magnetic drag, including both Pedersen and Hall drag components, and associated frictional heating in the globally neutral atmosphere, is implemented in the 3D General Circulation Model ExoRad to study WASP-18 b's atmosphere. Climate characteristics are compared for different drag formulations to assess whether anisotropic physics is required to capture magnetic coupling effects. Anisotropic magnetic drag and frictional heating, both set by local ionization, strongly affect wind strength and direction in the upper atmosphere, modify the day-night circulation, and produce observable temperature asymmetries. They enhance the evening-morning terminator temperature difference near 0.1 bar and generate two off-equator hotspots with reduced eastward shift. The terminator regions are particularly sensitive to how magnetic drag is modeled. Anisotropic magnetic drag damps and redirects dayside-to-nightside winds, partially decoupling the equatorial flow at the morning terminator while maintaining the nightside jet.

Abstract abridged", "summary": "Increasing interest in young exoplanets is leading to a growing effort to understand the formation and evolutionary processes responsible for their different architectures. One interesting target is TOI-5734, a relatively young K3-K4 dwarf star ($500_{-150}^{+300}$ Myr) showing a transiting candidate in photometric observations followed up with high-resolution spectroscopic data. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-5734b and measured its orbital period ($P_{\\rm b}\\sim6.18$ d), radius ($R_{\\rm b} = 2.10^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ $R_\\oplus$), and mass ($M_{\\rm b}=9.1^{+2.6}_{-2.6}$ $M_\\oplus$). By measuring its density ($\u03c1_{\\rm b}=0.98_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ $\u03c1_\\oplus$), we infer that TOI-5734b is close to having a rocky composition and an almost completely depleted primary envelope.

Their primordial nature holds key clues to the evolution of the Solar System. It has been suggested that the volatile-rich bodies formed in the outer Solar System and were implanted into the main belt. Alternatively, volatiles may have been delivered via inward-drifting icy pebbles in the protosolar disk. Here, we examine whether in-situ formed rocky embryos can acquire volatiles through pebble accretion as the snowline migrated inward. With the turbulence strength of the disk, radial pebble flux, and the dimensionless stopping time of pebbles (St) as parameters, we calculate the growth of large asteroids. The results are then compared with mass and compositional constraints based on asteroid observations. We find that a moderate pebble flux ($\\lesssim18~M_\\oplus / \\text{Myr}$) is required to enable volatile delivery while preventing the largest asteroids from becoming more massive than Ceres. Water accretion is feasible with $\\mathrm{St} \\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\\sim 1$ mm). However, only the largest asteroids (D > 200 km) can accumulate sufficient ammonia under such conditions. For most asteroids with D between 100 and 200 km, ammonia ice accretion requires $\\mathrm{St} \\sim 10^{-4}$ ($\\sim 100\\,\u03bc$m). Such small particle sizes may pose both theoretical and observational challenges. Thus, we propose that the intermediate-sized, potentially ammonia-bearing asteroids serve as a record of the Solar System's dynamic evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e3b\u5e26\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u5185\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u51b0\u8d28\u9897\u7c92\u83b7\u5f97\u6325\u53d1\u7269\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u83b7\u53d6\u6c34\u548c\u6c28\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u4e3b\u5e26\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u65e5\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6210\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6c34\u5230\u5bcc\u542b\u6c34\u5408\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6c28\u5316\u7269\u8d28\u3002\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u5916\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u540e\u8fc1\u79fb\u800c\u6765\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5185\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u51b0\u8d28\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u672c\u5730\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u9897\u7c92\u5438\u79ef\u83b7\u53d6\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u53c2\u6570\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u76d8\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5f84\u5411\u9897\u7c92\u901a\u91cf\u3001\u9897\u7c92\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4(St)\u3002\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u5206\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u7b49\u9897\u7c92\u901a\u91cf(\u227218 M\u2295/Myr)\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u8f93\u9001\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u6700\u5927\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u8c37\u795e\u661f\u3002\u6c34\u5438\u79ef\u5728St\u223c10\u207b\u00b3(\u7ea61mm)\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u6700\u5927\u5c0f\u884c\u661f(D>200km)\u80fd\u5728\u6b64\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u79ef\u7d2f\u8db3\u591f\u6c28\u3002\u4e2d\u7b49\u5927\u5c0f\u5c0f\u884c\u661f(100-200km)\u9700\u8981St\u223c10\u207b\u2074(\u7ea6100\u03bcm)\u624d\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u6c28\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c0f\u9897\u7c92\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u7b49\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u53ef\u80fd\u542b\u6c28\u7684\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u6c28\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5c0f\u9897\u7c92\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

Appendix: 20 pages, 47 figures", "summary": "DMPP is a radial-velocity survey that aims to detect planets around stars exhibiting anomalous activity signatures, consistent with the presence of close-in evaporating planets. Here, we report the discovery of 7 new planetary signals in 5 different systems: DMPP-2c & d, HD67200/DMPP-6b & c, HD118006/DMPP-7b, HD191122/DMPP-8b, and HD200133/DMPP-9b. We update the orbital parameters of the DMPP-1, DMPP-2, and DMPP-3 systems, along with those of the planetary systems orbiting HD181433, HD39194, and HD89839. We derive detection limits for all 24 targets in our sample with adequate observational coverage, and test the DMPP hypothesis by calculating the occurrence rates for planets in this configuration. We find that the occurrence rates of planets in our sample with orbital periods shorter than $50~\\mathrm{d}$ and masses in the range $3$-$10$ M$_\\oplus$ are $83.0^{+27.1}_{-24.4}\\%$, for $10$-$30$ M$_\\oplus$ are $27.0^{+15.0}_{-11.2}\\%$, and for $30$-$100$ M$_\\oplus$ are $13.9^{+11.8}_{-7.5}\\%$. This is significantly higher than the occurrence rates reported by other radial velocity surveys, providing strong support for the DMPP hypothesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMPP\u5de1\u5929\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u65b0\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u591a\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u884c\u661f\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u5de1\u5929\uff0c\u652f\u6301DMPP\u5047\u8bf4", "motivation": "DMPP\u5de1\u5929\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6697\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u84b8\u53d1\u884c\u661f\uff09\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1DMPP\u5047\u8bf4", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6cd5\u89c2\u6d4b24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u884c\u661f\u51fa\u73b0\u7387", "result": "\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u65b0\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u4e8e5\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u66f4\u65b06\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u884c\u661f\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u5de1\u5929", "conclusion": "DMPP\u5de1\u5929\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u884c\u661f\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3aDMPP\u5047\u8bf4\uff08\u5f02\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u793a\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u84b8\u53d1\u884c\u661f\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301"}}
