In this work, we investigate the early stages of planetesimal\naccretion, modeling the joint collisional and dynamical evolution of\nplanetesimals under the gravitational influence of a cold Jupiter and a\nviscously-dissipating massive protoplanetary disk.

This prevalent outcome is the\nresult of an initial stage of planetesimal accretion over the first 10 kyrs,\nfollowed by orbital transport driven by a secular apsidal resonance sweeping\ninward on Myr timescales. Our findings highlight the crucial role of giant\nplanets in redistributing solids within the inner disk.

It indicates\nlower-tropospheric downwelling in zones and upwelling in belts because the mean\nmeridional circulation almost certainly closes at depth. Yet the observed\nbanded structure of Jupiter's clouds and hazes suggests that there is upwelling\nin the brighter zones and downwelling in the darker belts. Here, we show that\nthis apparent contradiction can be resolved by considering not the Eulerian but\nthe transformed Eulerian mean circulation, which includes a Stokes drift owing\nto eddies and is a better approximation of the Lagrangian mean transport of\ntracers such as ammonia. The potential vorticity structure inferred from\nobservations paired with mixing length arguments suggests that there is\ntransformed Eulerian mean upwelling in zones and downwelling in belts.\nSimulations with a global circulation model of Jupiter's upper atmosphere\ndemonstrate the plausibility of these inferences and allow us to speculate on\nthe band structure at deeper levels."}

Evidence supports the existence of buffering feedbacks on Earth,\nbut whether these same feedbacks are active on other Earth-like planets remains\nuntested, as does the habitable zone hypothesis. While feedbacks are central to\nthe habitable zone concept, one does not guarantee the other-i.e., it is\npossible that a planet may maintain stable surface conditions at a given solar\nluminosity without following the predicted $CO_2$ trend across the entire\nhabitable zone. Forthcoming exoplanet observations will provide an opportunity\nto test both ideas. In anticipation of this and to avoid premature conclusions\nbased on insufficient data, we develop statistical tests to determine how many\nobservations are needed to detect and quantify planetary-scale feedbacks. Our\nmodel-agnostic approach assumes only the most generic prediction that holds for\nany buffering feedback, allowing the observations to constrain feedback\nbehavior. That can then inform next-level questions about what specific\nphysical, chemical, and/or biological feedback processes may be consistent with\nobservational data. We find that [23, 74](95% CI) observations are required to\ndetect feedback behavior within a given solar luminosity range, depending on\nthe sampling order of planets. These results are from tests using conservative\nerror tolerance-a measure used to capture the risk of false positives. Reducing\nerror tolerance lowers the chance of false positives but requires more\nobservations; increasing it reduces the required sample size but raises\nuncertainty in estimating population characteristics. We discuss these\ntrade-offs and their implications for testing the habitable zone hypothesis."}

Rimmer"], "title": "Nitrogen chemistry of hycean worlds on the example of K2-18b", "comment": "21 pages, 23 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "A recent observation of the exoplanet K2-18b sparked interest among\nscientists - large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane were detected in an\nH2-rich background atmosphere. If the planet is a hycean world (liquid water\nocean + hydrogen-dominated atmosphere), it could be habitable under certain\nconditions. The presence of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen was already confirmed,\nhowever, there was no detection of nitrogen or its compounds. Molecular\nnitrogen is difficult to detect directly. This study concentrates on possible\nphotochemical products of N2 such as HCN, NH3 and HC3N. We set approximate\nlimits on the amount of nitrogen bearing species by varying atmospheric\nparameters, such as the Eddy Diffusion coefficient and the amount of N2 present\nfrom 10 ppm to 10%. If the bulk nitrogen-containing gas in the atmosphere is\nN2, photochemistry produces only trace amounts of the aforementioned species.\nHowever, if ammonia is the main source of nitrogen, then the quantities of NH3,\nCH5N and HCN approach detectable range. HC3N and NO are bad tracers of the\nnitrogen source in the atmosphere, because they are produced in similar amounts\nin all tested scenarios. Assuming equilibrium chemistry at the surface of\nK2-18b results in underprediction of CO2 abundance. This result combined with\nthe non-detection of ammonia by JWST suggests the planet is not a typical\nsub-Neptune, but could be indeed a hycean world or magma ocean planet. We also\nfound that C2H6 is produced in significant amounts - if it is detected in the\nfuture, it could serve as a proxy for DMS presence."}

Detectability of Giant Exomoons of Wide Separation Giant Planets", "comment": "28 pages, 12 figures, accepted to AJ", "summary": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will conduct a Galactic\nExoplanet Survey (RGES) to discover bound and free-floating exoplanets using\ngravitational microlensing. Roman should be sensitive to lenses with mass down\nto ~ 0.02 $M_{\\oplus}$, or roughly the mass of Ganymede. Thus the detection of\nmoons with masses similar to the giant moons in our Solar System is possible\nwith Roman. Measuring the demographics of exomoons will provide constraints on\nboth moon and planet formation. We conduct simulations of Roman microlensing\nevents to determine the effects of exomoons on microlensing light curves, and\nwhether these effects are detectable with Roman. We focus on giant planets from\n30 $M_{\\oplus}$ to 10 $M_{Jup}$ on orbits from 0.3 to 30 AU, and assume that\neach planet is orbited by a moon with moon-planet mass ratio from $10^{-4}$ to\n$10^{-2}$ and separations from 0.1 to 0.5 planet Hill radii. We find that Roman\nis sensitive to exomoons, although the number of expected detections is only of\norder one over the duration of the survey, unless exomoons are more common or\nmassive than we assumed. We argue that changes in the survey strategy, in\nparticular focusing on a few fields with higher cadence, may allow for the\ndetection of more exomoons with Roman. Regardless, the ability to detect\nexomoons reinforces the need to develop robust methods for modeling triple lens\nmicrolensing events to fully utilize the capabilities of Roman."}
