This live camera, installed on the Subaru Telescope dome in the summit region of Maunakea, Hawai'i, features a wide field of view (70 deg by 40 deg) and high sensitivity, capable of observing stars fainter than 6th magnitude. Meteor detection was performed in two ways: visual inspection by citizen viewers and subsequent validation through automated detection. As a result, we confirmed that the number of meteors appearing from near the predicted radiant increased by more than six times (~9 sigma) compared to the preceding and following days. Our observation time was 4-5 hours after the predicted peak (solar longitude = 193.9 deg), providing clear data indicating that the activity had not yet declined. Optical observations at this time from the Northern Hemisphere are extremely limited and unique, making our observation point valuable. The meteors are characterized as slow and faint appearance, but several brighter meteors with wakes were also observed. Simulations tracing the dust trails from the parent body, Comet 15P/Finlay, suggest that our detection can be explained by either the dust trails released in 2008 or 2014, both requiring high ejection velocities. However, during the comet's 2008 return, its activity was exceptionally quiet, making a high-velocity dust ejection questionable. On the other hand, multiple large outbursts were observed during the 2014 return, at which time a certain amount of high-velocity dust release is expected. We conclude that the dust source of the meteor shower detected in Hawai'i this time is likely attributable to high-velocity (~67 m s-1) dust ejected during the 2014 outburst."}

As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway--a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)--a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry--peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties--stellar type and orbital distance--and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry."}

Nixon"], "title": "On the orbital evolution of binaries with polar circumbinary disks", "comment": "12 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers."}

Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $σ$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $σ$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set."}

It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet's temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state."}
