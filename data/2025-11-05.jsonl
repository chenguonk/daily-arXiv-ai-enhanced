Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected\ntransiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured\nmicrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar\nmeteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys.\n  Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft\nISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify\nthe expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational\nreports.\n  Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD,\nradar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the\npower-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured\nfluxes to predictions.\n  Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained\nby meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An\n$r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs\noverpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of\n$r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits,\nrespectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of\n$10^{3}$-$10^{6}$.\n  Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor\nsurvey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar\nmeteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local\nInterstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems.\nThis gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes\nrather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either\nthe dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess\nspacecraft dust fluxes."}

Our aims are\ntwofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can\nreproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs.\nSecondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two\nevolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and\nexternally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on\nthe mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve\nsynthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated\nmodels for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both\ninternal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both\nevolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field\nenvironments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment\nsimilar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to\nreproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different\nparameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc\nlifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and\nstrongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are\nmuch larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing\nwith time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field\nenvironment is ~100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further\nshow that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss\nrates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e.\nMHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution\nscenarios."}

It has recently been shown that the torques\nproduced by the gas and dust density variations around a non-accreting low-mass\nplanet, the so-called cold thermal and dust streaming torques, can surpass each\nof the other torque components. We investigate how the total torque acting on\nthe planet is affected by the presence of dust grains and their aerodynamic\nback-reaction on gas, while taking into account the cold thermal torque\nproduced by thermal diffusion in the gas component. We perform high-resolution\nlocal and global three-dimensional two-fluid simulations within the\npressureless-fluid dust approximation using the Fargo3D code. We explore the\ninfluence of different dust species parameterized by the Stokes number,\nfocusing on non-accreting protoplanets with masses from one-third the mass of\nMars to one Earth mass. The dust feedback has substantial impact on the\nasymmetry of the cold thermal lobes (which produce the cold thermal torque).\nHowever, the total torque is dominated by the dust torque when St $>10^{-2}$.\nThe dust torque becomes more negative over time due to the formation of dust\nlobes that resemble the cold thermal lobes that form in the gas component.\nTherefore, the dust streaming torque prevails over the cold thermal torque. On\nthe other hand, when St $\\leq10^{-2}$, the dust streaming torque is negligible\nand thus, the total torque on the planet comes from the gaseous component of\nthe disk. Our results suggest that a planet embedded in a gas-dust disk may\nexperience stagnant migration or inward runaway migration in regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk where the dust is not fully coupled to the gas. However,\nthis behaviour could change in regions with strong dust-gas coupling or in the\ninner transition region of the disk, where the cold thermal torque may become\nrelevant."}

We investigate the resolved Balmer hydrogen\nemission-line profiles and their variability in the ~13Mjup, 30-45 Myr-old\ncompanion Delorme to constrain the underlying accretion mechanisms. Using\nVLT/UVES, we obtained 31 new epochs of high-resolution optical spectra (330-680\nnm, R = 50,000), probing variability from hours to years. We analyze the shape\nand flux variability of hydrogen emission lines and compare them to two\nproposed origins: magnetospheric accretion funnels and localized accretion\nshocks. We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV\ncontinuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are\nvariable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary\nonly in flux. The broader velocity component correlates strongly with the UV\nexcess and is qualitatively consistent with magnetospheric funnel models, but\nnot with shock models. This component dominates the shape variability. The\nnarrower component, which correlates less with the UV excess, is better matched\nby shock-emission models and drives most of the flux variability. Line fluxes\nshow low variability on hour timescales but up to ~100% over weeks, similar to\nT Tauri stars. Our findings support magnetospheric accretion as the origin of\nthe broad component. The narrow component may arise from accretion shocks or\nchromospheric activity.

These observations, recorded over a long baseline\nof nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary\noblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of\nstudies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's\noblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling\nchoices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline (\"katahdin\")\nand two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model\ncomparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate\nplanet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively\nimpacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative\nof our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of\n$f<0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\\geq7.11$ hours if the\nplanet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the\nfinal bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model,\nand that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f<0.065$\nat 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on\nplanetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating\nexposure-long trends and correlated noise."}

We modelled three disc\nwind scenarios with different levels of magnetisation: a relatively strongly\nmagnetised wind ($\\beta$4), a rather weakly magnetised wind ($\\beta$6), and a\npurely photoevaporative wind (PE).
