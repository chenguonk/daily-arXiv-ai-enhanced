However, the stellar high energy fluxes that\npower hydrodynamic escape and set predicted mass loss rates can be uncertain by\nmultiple orders of magnitude. These uncertainties can be bypassed by studying\nmass loss for planets within the same system, as they have effectively\nundergone scaled versions of the same irradiation history. The TOI-4010 system\nis an ideal test case for mass loss models, as it contains three Neptune-sized\nplanets with planet b located in the `Neptune desert', planet c in the `Neptune\nridge', and planet d in the `Neptune savanna'. Using Keck/NIRSPEC, we measured\nthe metastable helium transit depths of all three planets in order to search\nfor evidence of atmospheric escape. We place upper bounds on the excess helium\nabsorption of 1.23\\%, 0.81\\%, and 0.87\\% at 95\\% confidence for TOI-4010~b, c\nand d respectively.

We collected a series of follow-up observations\nincluding high-spectral resolution observations with HARPS-N over a period of\nfive years. Our modelling shows that the K0V star hosts two transiting\nsub-Neptunes with Rb = 3.04 +/- 0.19 RE, Rc = 2.75 +/- 0.14 RE, Mb = 9.4 +/-\n1.8 ME, and Mc = 10.6 +/- 2.1 ME. The orbital periods of planets b and c are\n5.1 and 9.4 days, respectively, corresponding to instellations of 145 +/- 10\nand 65 +/- 4 FE. The bulk densities are 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 g cm-3,\nrespectively, suggesting a volatile-rich interior composition. We computed a\nset of planet interior structure models. Planet b presents a high-metallicity\nenvelope that can accommodate up to 2.5 % in H/He in mass, while planet c\ncannot have more than 0.2 % as H/He in mass. For any composition of the core\nconsidered (Fe-rock or ice-rock), both planets would require a volatile-rich\nenvelope. In addition to the two planets, the radial velocity (RV) data clearly\nreveal a third signal, likely coming from a non-transiting planet, with an\norbital period of 7.6 +1.6 -2.4 years and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of\n35+3-5 m s-1. Our best fit model finds a minimum mass of 2.1 +/- 0.3 MJ and an\neccentricity of 0.25+0.08-0.11. However, several RV activity indicators also\nshow strong signals at similar periods, suggesting this signal might (partly)\noriginate from stellar activity. More data over a longer period of time are\nneeded to conclusively determine the nature of this signal. If it is confirmed\nas a triple-planet system, TOI-1438 would be one of the few detected systems to\ndate characterised by an architecture with two small, short-period planets and\none massive, long-period planet, where the inner and outer systems are\nseparated by an orbital period ratio of the order of a few hundred.", "AI": {"tldr": "TESS\u53d1\u73b0TOI-1438\u591a\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9897\u4e9a\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5185\u884c\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u9897\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5de8\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u7b2c\u4e09\u9897\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u786e\u8ba4", "motivation": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5177\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TESS\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HARPS-N\u8fdb\u884c5\u5e74\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u83b7\u5f97\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u4e24\u9897\u4e9a\u6d77\u738b\u661f\uff1a\u884c\u661fb\uff083.04\u00b10.19\u5730\u7403\u534a\u5f84\uff0c9.4\u00b11.8\u5730\u7403\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u884c\u661fc\uff082.75\u00b10.14\u5730\u7403\u534a\u5f84\uff0c10.6\u00b12.1\u5730\u7403\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u5206\u522b\u4e3a5.1\u5929\u548c9.4\u5929\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u957f\u5468\u671f\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5468\u671f\u7ea67.6\u5e74\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u8d28\u91cf2.1\u00b10.3\u6728\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\uff09", "conclusion": "TOI-1438\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u9897\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u548c\u4e00\u9897\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u7b2c\u4e09\u9897\u884c\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u89c2\u6d4b\u786e\u8ba4\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u661f\u800c\u975e\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8"}}

In this work we aim to understand how the\nsuper-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the\nprotoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary\ndisc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble\naccretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards\nmigration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in\nsuper-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when\nviscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying\nmigration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction\nof super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in\na significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an\nincrease in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features\nof the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced\nwhen the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer\ntime-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time\nearly on in the disc lifetime.

In this\npaper, we present our study on the impact of enhanced EUV flux on the stability\nand escape of the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global\nIonosphere and Thermosphere Model (GITM). We also investigate the differences\nbetween one- and three-dimensional solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV\nflux experienced at the Earth, and multiplying this flux by a constant factor\ngoing up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and elevated\nionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a detailed picture of how\ndifferent heating and cooling rates, as well as the conductivity are changing\nat each EUV flux level. Our results also demonstrate that one-dimensional\nsolutions are limited in their ability to capture a global atmosphere that are\nnot uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux level for a stable atmosphere\noccurs around a factor of 10 times the baseline level, where EUV fluxes above\nthis level indicate a rapidly escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux\ntranslates to about 0.3AU for a planet orbiting the Sun.
