We include stellar spectrum heating and ionization, radiative cooling by Lyman-$α$ and H$_3^+$, heat conduction, tidal gravity, a H-He reaction network, and account for the secondary ionization of species by photoelectrons. For a fiducial hot Jupiter, we uncover a three-layer structure: an H$_3^+$-cooled layer of molecular hydrogen at the base, enveloped by a Lyman-$α$-cooled layer of neutral hydrogen, which transitions into an ionized wind layer that is cooled by adiabatic expansion. The highest spectral energy photons are deposited in the molecular layer, where, after accounting for energy loss via photoelectrons and ionization, H$_3^+$ is a substantial radiative coolant. We run a grid of models, varying the distance of our fiducial planet from the star. We find that heat conduction at the base starts to have an effect at distances $\\gtrsim 0.2$ au, increasing the H$_3^+$ cooling relative to the EUV input flux. At increasing stellocentric distances, the outflow becomes increasingly more neutral. The neutral hydrogen starts to decouple from the ionized outflow, free-streaming out. In pure H-He mini-Neptune/super-Earth simulations, the outflows are significantly cooler, allowing molecules to survive throughout the outflow, pointing toward the likely importance of molecular cooling in determining whether these planets can maintain massive atmospheres. The analysis in this paper provides a framework for understanding the impact of molecular radiative cooling on atmospheric outflows."}

The majority of these binaries, especially among the near-earth or main belt asteroids have small radius ratios, implying a large difference in size between the primary and its companion. Farther from the sun, the binary fraction increases, with the Kuiper Belt having many known binaries with radius ratios of order unity. In this paper, we consider the runaway growth of a binary system in an accretionary stream of small particles. We perform brute-force integrations, each with 10 million test particles and numerically compute the gravitational cross sections for each member of the binary as a function of the system's separation and mass ratio. We show that the behavior of the cross section is complex, and it can be either diminished or enhanced depending on the orbital configuration. In the regime where gravitational focusing dominates the accretion process, we show that binaries grow towards smaller mass ratios than would be expected given single-body cross sections. Finally, we provide a grid of these cross sections for use in the future study of such systems."}

Orbiting a G-type star every ~100 days, the Saturn-mass exoplanet TOI-199 b ($T_{\\rm eq}=350$ K) is one of the most favorable low-temperature gas giants for atmospheric study. Here, we present its transmission spectrum from a single transit observed with JWST's NIRSpec G395M mode. Despite lower-than-nominal precision due to a pointing misalignment, Bayesian retrievals reveal the presence of CH$_4$ (Bayes factor of $\\sim$700 in a cloudy atmosphere), corresponding to a metallicity of $\\rm{C/H}=13^{+78}_{-12}\\times$ solar, although the absence of detectable CO and CO$_2$ disfavors metallicities $\\gtrsim50\\times$ solar. We also tested several haze prescriptions (Titan-like tholin, soot, and water-rich tholin), but the preference for these models is weak (Bayes factors of $\\sim 2$ relative to the clear case). The spectrum also shows an increase in transit depth near 3 $μ$m, which our self-consistent models attribute to either NH$_3$ or, less likely, HCN. Follow-up observations will distinguish between these species, helping determine the planet's vertical mixing regime. The TOI-199 system exhibits strong transit timing variations (TTVs) due to an outer non-transiting giant planet. For planet c, our TTV analysis reduces its mass uncertainty by 50% and prefers a slightly longer orbital period (still within the conservative habitable zone) and higher eccentricity relative to previous studies. TOI-199 b serves as the first data point for studying clouds and hazes in temperate gas giants. The detection of methane supports the emerging trend that temperate low-molecular-weight atmospheres display spectral features in transmission."}

These sub-Neptunes are generally thought to have primary atmospheres of protoplanetary-disk gas origin. However, atmospheric escape followed by degassing from their interiors can lead to the transition to secondary atmospheres depleted in gases less-soluble to magma, such as helium. These primary and secondary atmospheres can potentially be distinguished from observations of escaping hydrogen and helium. This study aims to elucidate the impact of the primary-secondary transition on atmospheric compositions of short-period sub-Neptunes. We simulate their evolution with atmospheric escape driven by stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet irradiation and degassing of hydrogen, helium, and water from their rocky interiors, with a one-dimensional structure model. We show that the transition takes place for low-mass, close-in planets which experience extensive atmospheric escape. These planets show the depletion of helium and enrichment of water in their atmospheres, because of their low and high abundances in the planetary interiors, respectively. A compilation of our parameter survey (the orbital period, planetary mass, envelope mass, and mantle FeO content) shows a correlation between the planet radius and the helium escape rate. We suggest that the transition from primary to secondary atmospheres may serve an explanation for helium non-detection for relatively-small ($\\lesssim 2.5\\ R_\\oplus$) exoplanets."}

It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we introduce a patched-conic framework to describe the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle's orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\\mathbf{U}_\\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet's orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets)."}

Time-evolved models of the feedback between interior and atmosphere are critical to predict and interpret these observations and link them to the Solar System terrestrial planets. However, models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to significant differences in interpretation. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) project. CHILI is an (exo-)planet model intercomparison project within the Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES) framework, which aims to support a diverse set of multi-model intercomparison projects in the exoplanet community. The present protocol includes the initial set of participating magma ocean models, divided into evolutionary and static models, and two types of test categories, one focused on Solar System planets (Earth & Venus) and the other on exoplanets orbiting low-mass M-dwarfs. Both test categories aim to quantify the evolution of key markers of the links between planetary atmospheres and interiors over geological timescales. The proposed tests would allow us to quantify and compare the differences between coupled atmosphere-interior models used by the exoplanet and planetary science communities. Results from the proposed tests will be published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an example, we present initial test results for the early Earth and TRAPPIST-1 b, conducted with models differing in the treatment of energy transport in the planetary interior and atmosphere, surface boundary layer, geochemistry, and the in- and outgassing of volatile compounds."}

Our approach normalizes sparse photometric data to a pole-on geometry, enabling consistent phase-curve fitting across apparitions. We fit both the H,G1,G2 and H,G12 phase functions to the normalized data. We also numerically derive new constraints on parameter ranges that ensure physically meaningful solutions. These constraints are based on the requirement that the reduced magnitude must monotonically decrease with phase angle and remain within plausible slope bounds. Compared to earlier bounds, our new constraints are more permissive. We also compare derivative-based and derivative-free optimization methods, highlighting convergence issues with the HG12 function and offering mitigation strategies. We applied our method to over 25,000 asteroids observed by the ATLAS survey, demonstrating its usability. The new method enables the selection of the preferred spin-and-shape solution based on either statistical phase-curve model selection criteria and/or physically motivated constraints on the phase-curve shape."}

For our analysis, we have used REBOUND, an N-Body simulation package, to study these situations. We use the adaptive size mathematical integrator \\textsc{Ias15}, with a 1-day time step for long-term integration, and a 1-hour time step to study the effect of the planets on this body during the close encounters. We have seen an effect of Jupiter on the orbital parameters of the comet, which affects its post-perijove trajectory significantly. The impact of Mars on this comet is minimal compared to the effect of Jupiter. This is consistent with the point that the comet moves well past Mars's Hill radius but very close to Jupiter's Hill radius at the respective close approaches. However, the effect of non-gravitational forces will alter the results. Since the non-gravitational forces are not yet known, we predict the variation of the orbital parameters considering a range of possible magnitudes of the non-gravitational acceleration."}

The auroral emissions are believed to be excited by interaction between the exoplanet and the winds of its host star. Since stellar winds respond to stellar surface magnetism, three-dimensional stellar wind modelling, able to account for the star's contemporaneous magnetic field geometry, can aid the interpretation of radio detections. For the first time, we present spectropolarimetric observations of $τ$ Boötis A from the same epoch as the LOFAR detections. We derive a contemporaneous large-scale magnetic map of $τ$ Boötis A, which shows a poloidally dominated field with mean strength 1.6 G. From our magnetic map, we create a three-dimensional numerical wind model and characterise the wind properties around $τ$ Boötis Ab. To compute the wind power dissipated in $τ$ Boötis Ab's magnetosphere, we apply two approaches: A) the solar system-based empirical relation called Bode's law; and B) a resolved numerical model of the planetary magnetosphere. When consistently applying best-case assumptions, we redict radio flux densities around 50 mJy and 0.68 mJy respectively. Our values are much too small to be consistent with the reported observation of $890_{-500}^{+690}$ mJy; a stellar surface magnetic field scaling $\\gtrsim 10$ is required to reproduce the observed signal strength. As $τ$ Boötis A has a rapid magnetic cycle, we speculate that wind variations cased by variation in stellar magnetism may explain the lack of detections from follow-up observations. Our work emphasises the importance of contemporaneous observations of stellar magnetism and observational signatures of star-planet interaction."}

This version corresponds to the accepted manuscript", "summary": "The measurement of dust size from millimeter-wavelength spectra provides direct constraints on grain growth in protoplanetary disks. The spectral indices between 0.88 mm and 2.9 mm have been measured in multiple young star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Ophiuchus, and Lupus, which have ages of 1-3 Myr. These spectral indices are as low as 2-3, suggesting that grains in disks are much larger than those in the interstellar medium. In this study, we analyze the ALMA archival data of 23 disks in the Upper Scorpius region. The observed wavelength is 2.9 mm in Band 3, the angular resolution is 3.3 arcsec x 2.1 arcsec, which is not high enough to resolve the targets, and the rms noise is below 0.075 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for almost all sources. Together with the literature values of the Band 7 fluxes of the same targets, we find that the average spectral index of the disks in the Upper Scorpius region is $α_\\mathrm{mm}=2.09 \\pm 0.10$, which is equal to or slightly smaller than those at the other younger regions. To explain the relationship between the fluxes and spectral indices of the disks in the Taurus, Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius regions, we construct simple disk evolution models. The observations are best reproduced by models in which the inner radius of the disk increases. This suggests that a substantial amount of dust mass must persist in the outer disk regions where the dust temperature is lower than 20 K even at late evolutionary stages. These findings offer key insights into the grain growth and the temporal evolution of protoplanetary disks."}

These asteroids belong to the spectroscopic C-complex, to the X-types with low geometric visible albedo values as well as to the T- and D-type end members of the Bus-DeMeo spectroscopic taxonomy. Here we used Gaia Data Release 3 visible reflectance spectra to study the average spectral profiles of the C- and X-complex asteroid families in the central and outer main belt (orbital semi-major axis between 2.5 - 3.7~au). We found that eight of these families, namely 96 Aegle, 627 Charis, 1484 Postrema and 5438 Lorre, previously classified as C-complex families, and 322 Phaeo, 1303 Luthera, 5567 Durisen and 53546 2000BY6 previously classified as X-complex families, have redder slopes than implied by their previous classification and could be better classified as T-/D-type families. Some of these families may also feed the near-Earth asteroid population, being responsible for the observed T-/D-type excess. However, the analysis of their principal components of Gaia Data Release 3 spectra suggest that further near-infrared observations are needed in order to verify this identification."}

Large-scale and homogeneous TTV analyses are a valuable method to complement the demographics of planetary systems and understand the role of dynamical interactions. We present the results of a systematic TTV analysis of 423 systems covering 16000 transits, each with a single transiting planet first discovered by the TESS mission and afterwards confirmed or validated. The primary aim of this survey is to identify the most promising candidates for dynamically active systems that warrant further investigation. In the first stage of our analysis, precise measurements of the transit times are extracted for each system in an homogeneous way. In the second stage, we apply a decision framework to classify candidates by analyzing the resulting variations. Based on excess timing scatter and the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion of periodic models over linear ones, the TTVs are classified as significant, marginal, or non-detections. We find 11 systems with significant TTVs, 5 of which were announced in previous works, and 10 more systems with marginal evidence in our sample. We present 3-panel diagnostic plots for all the candidates, showing phase-folded light curves, the transit variations over time, and the variations folded on the recovered TTV period. A comprehensive summary table detailing the fitted parameters and TTV significance for the entire survey is also provided. This survey constitutes the largest homogeneous TTV analysis of TESS systems to date.

I. Ejection of Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems", "comment": "20 pages, Accepted to MNRAS", "summary": "Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s > 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory."}
