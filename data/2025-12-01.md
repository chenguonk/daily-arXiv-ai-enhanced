TL;DR: HIP-44302最初被TESS卫星误认为系外行星候选体，但实际上是三恒星系统，其中包含一个9.6天周期的食双星和一个孤立的A型星，排除了行星存在的可能性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过详细建模验证HIP-44302系统的真实性质，排除系外行星假阳性，开发新的假阳性识别方法。

Method: 使用EXOFASTv2软件包结合高分辨率AO成像、斑点成像、凌星数据和光谱能量分布，对三颗恒星进行全局建模。

Result: 确认系统为三恒星系统：一个9.599214天周期的食双星（包含A型和G型星）与一个孤立的A型星组成，轨道分离约297 AU，周期约1886年。

Conclusion: 成功开发了结合成像、测光和全局建模的新假阳性识别范式，能够有效排除污染候选目录的假阳性目标。

Abstract: Through detailed modeling of all three stars, we show that HIP-44302 is a false positive triple-star system. While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $ρ= 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\sim$297 AU, $\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进HITRAN数据库中甲烷的光谱参数，通过整合多项研究数据，提高数据库在特定光谱区域的准确性和完整性，以满足多个遥感仪器的需求。

Method: 收集多项研究的光谱参数，使用高分辨率FTS和CRDS光谱进行验证，在特定区域进行多谱线列表的光谱拟合比较，采用最佳拟合参数，并使用Pade近似函数和半经验公式更新压力展宽数据。

Result: 成功替换了约6万条谱线，包括5.6万个跃迁波数、1.6万个谱线强度、3万个压力展宽半宽度和3500个谱线归属，新增4万条谱线，数据库覆盖范围扩展至14000 cm⁻¹。

Conclusion: 通过系统性的数据整合和验证过程，显著提升了HITRAN数据库中甲烷光谱参数的准确性和完整性，特别是在五重态、八重态和十四重态区域，为遥感应用提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 60,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 56,000 transition wavenumbers, 16,000 line intensities, 30,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3500 assignments. 40,000 new lines were added, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $ν_3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $ν_3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.

TL;DR: 研究发现振动激发的H2分子会移除He+离子，从而抑制暖系外海王星上He I三重态线的吸收，解释了GJ 3470 b和GJ 436 b上该谱线未检测到的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在暖系外海王星上H I莱曼-α吸收很强，但He I三重态线吸收却很弱或未被检测到，特别是针对GJ 3470 b和GJ 436 b这两个行星。

Method: 利用理论和实验数据形成热速率系数，模拟振动激发的H2分子移除He+离子的化学过程，该过程在He I三重态线探测的大气层温度下变得特别快。

Result: 模拟显示该过程严重抑制了GJ 3470 b上的He I三重态线吸收，并导致GJ 436 b上未检测到该谱线。该机制的效率与大气中H2到H的转变位置以及行星接收的高能辐射量有关。

Conclusion: 弱的He I三重态线吸收不一定意味着缺乏原始的H2-He主导大气，这对解释其他小型系外行星的观测结果具有重要意义。

Abstract: Context. Neptune-sized exoplanets or exo-Neptunes are fundamental in the description of exoplanet diversity. Their evolution is sculpted by atmospheric escape, often traced by absorption in the H i Lyman-α line at 1,216 Å and the He i triplet line at 1.08 μm. On warm exo-Neptunes HAT-P-11 b, GJ 3470 b and GJ 436 b, H i Lyman-α absorption causes extreme in-transit obscuration of their host stars. This suggests that He i triplet line absorption will also be strong, yet it has only been identified on two of these planets. Aims. We explore previously unaccounted for processes that might attenuate the He i triplet line on warm exo-Neptunes. In particular, we assess the role of vibrationally excited H2 to remove the He+ ion that acts as precursor of the absorbing He(2$^3$S ). Methods. We formed thermal rate coefficients for this chemical process, leveraging the available theoretical and experimental data. The process becomes notably fast at the temperatures expected in the atmospheric layers probed by the He i triplet line. Results. Our simulations show that the proposed process severely mutes the line on GJ 3470 b and causes the nondetection on GJ 436 b. The overall efficiency of this mechanism is connected to where in the atmosphere the H2-to-H transition occurs and, ultimately, to the amount of high-energy radiation received by the planet. The process will be more significant on small exoplanets than on hotter or more massive ones, as for the latter the H2-to-H transition generally occurs deeper in the atmosphere. Conclusions. Weak He i triplet line absorption need not imply the lack of a primordial, H2-He-dominated atmosphere, an idea to bear in mind when interpreting the observations of other small exoplanets.

TL;DR: 通过比较阴影驱动和行星驱动两种机制产生的螺旋结构，研究发现阴影驱动会在CO分子谱线速度图中产生明显的双臂特征，而标准行星驱动则不会，这为区分两种机制提供了观测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率近红外观测发现许多系统中存在明显的双臂螺旋结构，这些结构可能由盘-伴星相互作用或阴影驱动机制产生，需要找到区分这两种机制的方法。

Method: 使用PLUTO进行两组成流体动力学模拟：一组包含完整辐射流体动力学和气体-尘埃碰撞，用于模拟阴影驱动的螺旋；另一组使用参数化β冷却，模拟标准行星驱动的螺旋波激发。然后使用RADMC3D进行蒙特卡洛辐射传输后处理。

Result: 阴影驱动情况下，强烈的垂直速度在CO分子谱线速度图中产生明显的双臂特征，特别是在面朝观测的较厚光学深度同位素中；而标准行星驱动情况下没有这种特征。

Conclusion: CO分子谱线速度图中是否存在双臂特征可以区分阴影驱动和行星驱动机制，有助于识别适合未来直接成像观测的目标。

Abstract: High-resolution, near-infrared observations have revealed prominent, two-armed spirals in a multitude of systems, such as MWC~758, SAO~206462, and V1247~Ori. Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $β$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns.

TL;DR: 使用VLT/CRIRES高分辨率光谱和ExoJAX框架对Luhman 16AB褐矮星双星进行大气反演，发现C/O比约为0.67（略高于太阳值），线列系统误差是主要不确定性来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估褐矮星大气反演结果对主要系统误差源的稳健性，特别是线列选择和温度-压力剖面参数化假设的影响。

Method: 使用高分辨率VLT/CRIRES光谱和ExoJAX框架，先采用幂律温度-压力剖面，然后引入高斯过程基的灵活温度-压力剖面进行非参数表征。

Result: 推断出C/O比约为0.67，线列系统误差（7%）是主要不确定性来源，温度-压力剖面参数化和光度变化影响较小。

Conclusion: Luhman 16AB成为亚恒星C/O测量的关键锚点，灵活温度-压力建模在高分辨率反演中具有实用性，系统测试（特别是线列不确定性）对褐矮星与巨系外行星比较至关重要。

Abstract: We present atmospheric retrievals of the benchmark brown dwarf binary Luhman 16AB using high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra and the differentiable framework ExoJAX. We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.

TL;DR: VHS 1256B是已知变化最大的行星质量天体，其近红外通量变化达40%。研究表明其大气由持续数十天的行星尺度沙尘暴主导，伴随赤道波传播的大片斑块云，这种天气模式解释了观测到的光谱和光变曲线特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VHS 1256B的近红外通量变化达40%，且JWST光谱显示红色和硅酸盐特征，这对现有理论构成挑战，需要解释其大气变化机制。

Method: 使用通用环流模型模拟VHS 1256B的大气动力学，分析沙尘暴和云的分布与演化。

Result: 模型显示VHS 1256B大气由行星尺度沙尘暴主导，持续数十天，伴随赤道波传播的斑块云，这种天气模式与太阳系巨行星的带状结构不同。

Conclusion: 这种独特的天气模式同时解释了观测到的光谱特征、光变曲线的大振幅、不规则演化、波长依赖性，以及近红外颜色-星等图中观测到的变化趋势。

Abstract: Large-amplitude variations are commonly observed in the atmospheres of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs. VHS 1256B, the most variable known planet-mass object, exhibits a near-infrared flux change of nearly 40%, with red color and silicate features revealed in recent JWST spectra, challenging current theories. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate that VHS 1256B's atmosphere is dominated by planetary-scale dust storms persisting for tens of days, with large patchy clouds propagating with equatorial waves. This weather pattern, distinct from the banded structures seen on solar system giants, simultaneously explains the observed spectra and critical features in the rotational light curves, including the large amplitude, irregular evolution, and wavelength dependence, as well as the variability trends observed in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of dusty substellar atmospheres.
