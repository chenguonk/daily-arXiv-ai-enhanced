While the core accretion paradigm is\nwidely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and\nintermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains\ndebated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their\nexistence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on\nmetallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy\nfor the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar\nphotospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in\nmetal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets,\nbut also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most\nmassive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in\nagreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass\ndistribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These\nfindings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a\ncentral role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses."}

Without the protection of an atmosphere, these planets\nare likely covered by a powder-like regolith, similar to the Moon. Laboratory\nstudies show that, under vacuum conditions, such regoliths can develop\nsubsurface temperature gradients, also known as the solid-state greenhouse\neffect. This effect can significantly modify the emission features of airless\nbodies, but its potential impact on exoplanets is still unexplored. Here we\nderive analytic solutions of the two-stream radiative transfer equations with\nscattering, absorption, plus emission, and combine them with Mie theory\ncalculations to model subsurface temperature gradients and emission spectra of\nairless exoplanets. The results show exo-regoliths can develop strong\nsolid-state greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effects, with temperature gradients\n$>200$~K in the upper-most subsurface ($\\mathcal{O}(100)\\mu$m). These\ntemperature gradients alter surface emission features, modify secondary eclipse\ndepths by up to $\\sim50\\%$, and can produce higher-than-blackbody emission at\nsome wavelengths. In addition, we study whether subsurface temperature\ngradients can be disentangled from other microscopic effects, such as changes\nin space weathering or particle size. At least in some cases, the co-existence\nof these effects makes it essentially impossible to distinguish different\nsurface compositions within the precisions achievable by JWST. Overall,\nsubsurface temperature gradients thus open potentially new ways to characterize\nsurfaces of airless exoplanets, but they also complicate the interpretation of\nairless exoplanet spectra. In either case, their effect can be important and\nshould be included in future modeling studies."}

We model how\nstellar activity cycles affect the atmospheric escape and HeI 1083nm signatures\nof four types of highly irradiated exoplanets, at 0.025 and 0.05 au, during\nminimum and maximum cycle phases. We consider two stars, exhibiting different\ncycle behaviours: the Sun and the more active star iota Hor, for which we\nreconstruct its spectral energy distributions at minimum and maximum phases\nusing X-ray observations and photospheric models. We show that over a modulated\nactivity cycle, the release of extreme ultraviolet photons, responsible for\natmospheric escape, varies substantially more than that of mid-UV photons,\ncapable of photoionising HeI (23S). This leads to consistently stronger helium\nsignatures during maximum phases. We show that planets at the largest orbit are\nmore affected by cycles, showing larger variations in escape rates and\nabsorptions between minimum and maximum. We also confirm the counter-intuitive\nbehaviour that, despite the fall-off in escape rate with orbital distance, the\nHeI 1083nm absorption is not significantly weaker at further orbits, even\nstrengthening with orbital distance for some iota Hor planets. We partially\nexplain this behaviour with the lower mid-UV fluxes at more distant orbits,\nleading to less HeI (23S) photoionisations.

We use a numerical model,\nassuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial\nmotions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum\nexchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling.
