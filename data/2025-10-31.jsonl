Submitted to ApJL", "summary": "Detection of an atmosphere around a terrestrial exoplanet will be a major\nmilestone in the field, but our observational capacities are biased towards to\ntidally locked, close-in planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. The atmospheres of\nthese planets are vulnerable to atmospheric erosion and collapse due to\ncondensation of volatiles on the nightside. However, these collapsed volatiles\naccumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be\nre-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a\nsimple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with\nstochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism\nfor CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \\rm{km}$\ndiameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \\rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate\nobservable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets. We focus on\nspecific targets from the JWST DDT Rocky Worlds programme, and compute the\nfraction of their evolution spent with a transient CO$_2$ atmosphere generated\nthrough this mechanism. We find this fraction can reach $70\\%$ for GJ 3929 b,\n$50\\%$ for LTT 1445 Ac, $80\\%$ for LTT 1445 Ab, at high impact rates and strong\nCO$_2$ outgassing over the planet's lifetime. We also show that atmospheric\ncollapse can shield volatiles from escape, particularly in the early, high-XUV\nphase of M-dwarf evolution. Overall, our work suggests that terrestrial planet\natmospheres may not evolve monotonically but instead may be shaped by episodic\nexternal forcings."}

Current systems such as NASA's Sentry-II, the University of\nPisa's CLOMON2, and ESA's Aegis have been highly successful, but independent\napproaches are essential to ensure reliability and to cross-validate\npredictions of possible impacts. We present NEOForCE (Near-Earth Objects'\nForecast of Collisional Events), a new independent monitoring system for\nasteroid impact prediction. By relying on orbital solutions from DynAstVO at\nParis Observatory and using an original methodology for uncertainty\npropagation, NEOForCE provides an alternative line of verification for impact\nassessments and strengthens the overall robustness of planetary defense. As\nother monitoring systems, NEOForCE samples several thousand virtual asteroids\nfrom the uncertainty region and integrates their orbits up to 100 years into\nthe future. Instead of searching for close approaches of the virtual asteroids\nwith the Earth, our system looks for times when the Earth comes close to the\nrealistic uncertainty regions around them, which are mostly stretched along\ntheir osculating orbits. We also estimate the maximal impact probability, and\nonly if this value is large enough do we continue to the next step. In this\nsecond step, we compute how the original asteroid orbit should be modified so\nthat the new trajectory leads to an Earth impact, which allows us to confirm\nthe possible collision and estimate the impact probability. We tested NEOForCE\nagainst NASA's Sentry-II system on five representative asteroids: 2000 SG344,\n2005 QK76, 2008 JL3, 2023 DO and 2025 JU. NEOForCE successfully recovered\nnearly all possible collisions reported by Sentry-II with impact probabilities\nabove e-7, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. In addition, NEOForCE\nidentified several potential impacts at the e-7 - e-6 level that Sentry-II did\nnot report."}

By comparing modeled thermal\nprofiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain\nbulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing\na variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional\nthermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its\ntrajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on\nmeasurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid\nbulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and\nconductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth\nthroughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the\nthermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal\nprofiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O,\nCO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the\nmodeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3\nau indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\\sim$150 K can only be\nachieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the\nalbedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2."}

Together with\nvertical mixing, this buoyancy forcing shapes key oceanic features, including\nzonal currents in thermal wind balance, baroclinic instability of those\ncurrents, meridional heat transport by eddies, and vertical stratification. We\nuse high-resolution numerical simulations to explore how variations in ice\nshell thickness affect these processes. Our simulations span a wide range of\ntopographic slopes, pole-to-equator temperature differences, and vertical\nmixing strengths, for both fresh and salty oceans. We find that baroclinic\neddies dominate large-scale circulation and meridional heat transport,\nconsistent with studies assuming a flat ice-ocean interface. However, sloped\ntopography introduces new effects: when lighter water overlies denser water\nalong the slope, circulation weakens as a stratified layer thickens beneath the\npoles. Conversely, when denser water lies beneath the poles, circulation\nstrengthens as topography increases the available potential energy. We develop\na scaling framework that predicts heat transport and stratification across all\nsimulations. Applying this framework to Enceladus, Europa, and Titan, we infer\nocean heat fluxes, stratification, and tidal energy dissipation and showing\nlarge-scale circulation constrains tidal heating and links future observations\nof ice thickness and rotation to subsurface ocean dynamics."}

Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant\nchannel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters\noffer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental\ntidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based\non a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties,\n{we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at\nabout 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with\nmultiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical\nexpectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which\naligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay.\nMoreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different\nchannels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within\nseveral tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk\nmigration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant\nportion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale\nextending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further\nsupported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our\nfindings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics\nand long-term evolution with multichannel formation."}

This\nunprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O\n= 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic\ncosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet\nnucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently\nconverts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the\nouter layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are\nconsistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed\nspectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that\ncurrent outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never\nreaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after\nperihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents\na paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal\nGCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their\nprimordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in\nOctober 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this\ninterpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary\npathway for interstellar objects."}

The latter\nincludes a set of volatile species, gas flow through the porous interior,\ncrystallization of amorphous ice, sublimation and refreezing of volatiles in\nthe pores. We follow the evolution of three models, with radii of 2, 10 and 50\nkm for 4.6 Gyr, through different dynamical epochs, starting in the vicinity of\nNeptune, moving to the Oort Cloud and after a long sojourn there, back inward\nto the planetary region. The initial composition includes a mixture of CO, CO2\nices, amorphous water ice with trapped CO and CO2, and dust.We find that the CO\nice is completely depleted in the small object, but preserved in the larger\nones from a depth of 500 m to the center, while the CO2 and the amorphous ice\nare entirely preserved. Of crucial importance is the change in CO abundance\nprofiles during the cooling phase, as the objects migrate to the OC. Upon\nreturn from the Oort Cloud, the activity is driven by CO sublimation at large\nheliocentric distances (up to 50 au), by CO2 inward of 13 au and by gas\nreleased from crystallizing amorphous ice at about 7 au.
