To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much)\nSO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet\natmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities\nfrom 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the\n'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be\nsufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of\nmetallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall\ntemperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV\nirradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq > 600 K), and is essentially\nindependent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number\nof giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending\non temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S\nare frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most\neasily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO\nand SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for\nadditional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for\nfuture work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully\nself-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of\nplanetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates\nand molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species"}

For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of\nGRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from\narXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining\neccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and\nyielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20).

Additionally, we calculate a median\nline-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further\ninsight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis\nagrees with arXiv:2302.04893, confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20))\nand an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly\ncoplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees.\nFor both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ\nformation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation."}

The PI group attributed this\nfeature to the He I 1.0833 micron triplet line. Here, I review the physics and\naeronomy of this well-known line of atmospheric origin. SPHEREx is in a\ndawn-dusk sun-synchronous polar orbit, circling the earth nearly 15 times a day\nand observing close to the terminator plane. With a height of 650 km, SPHEREx\nis located in the upper thermosphere that is dominated by atomic oxygen and\nhelium. The He I line is a result of resonance scattering of solar photons by\nmetastable helium atoms. It appears that SPHEREx has the capacity to provide a\nrich dataset (global, daily, and 2-minute cadence) of column density of\nmetastable helium in the upper thermosphere. As an example of this assertion,\nwith data from just one orbit, the winter helium bulge was readily seen. Rapid\nvariations in the column density of metastable helium is seen over the south\npole which is probably due to spatial structure in the distribution of\nmetastable helium as well as solar activity. Helium in the thermosphere is of\nconsiderable interest to operators of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites,\nsince drag in the thermosphere is the primary cause of the decay of these\nsatellites.

In this contribution,\nwe review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution,\nincluding infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models\nand nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials.\n  Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the\ndynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be\nubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more\ncomplex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of\ninvestigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory\ninclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive\nheterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and\nfine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data\ncompilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these\nanomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two\nmain families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to\nexplain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their\nrespective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We\nalso discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other\nchondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has\nstarted to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the\ndisk.

They challenge the internal structure models and prompt\ninvestigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the\ncharacterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521\n(T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate\nidentified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims\nat understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation\nstudies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based\nphotometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and\nphysical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of\nmass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with\nradius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively.\nMoreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass\nof Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b\nis a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e.\nInterestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity\n(e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If\nsuch eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric\nsub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities\n(4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram\nwhere different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich\ncomposition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope.

We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate\ntheir transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is\ndecomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of\nFourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an\nideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier\ncoefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that\nthe neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which\ndescribe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher\norder ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of\neccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape\ninformation in the light curve.

We present the\nmid-infrared spectrum from the CPD surrounding the young companion CT Cha b.\nThe data show a carbon-rich chemistry with seven carbon-bearing molecules (up\nto C$_6$H$_6$) and one isotopologue detected and indicate a high gaseous\nC/O$>$1 that is in contrast with the elemental abundance ratios typically\nmeasured in directly imaged gas giant atmospheres. This carbon-rich chemistry\nis also in stark contrast to the spectrum of the disk surrounding the host\nstar, CT Cha A, which shows no carbon-bearing molecules. This difference in\ndisk chemistry between the host disk and its companion indicates rapid,\ndivergent chemical evolution on $\\sim$million-year timescales.
