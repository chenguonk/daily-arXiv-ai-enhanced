### [1] [Implications for the formation of Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets in dense environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23653)
*Santiago Torres*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过数值模拟研究恒星团中太阳系类似系统的演化，发现致密盘主要通过行星-盘相互作用形成柯伊伯带和散射盘，而扩展盘则更多受恒星相遇影响形成奥尔特云结构和星际彗星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究恒星团环境中频繁的近距离相遇如何影响行星系统的早期结构演化，特别是太阳系中遥远彗星种群的起源。

Method: 使用LonelyPlanets框架结合NBODY6++GPU和REBOUND进行详细数值模拟，考虑扩展和致密两种初始配置，包含四个巨行星和不同尺寸的碎片盘。

Result: 发现恒星扰动在0-30度倾角时最有效，产生不同的动力学种群如Sednoids和内奥尔特云类似物；共面相遇保持盘面扁平，极向飞越则垂直重新分布角动量形成近各向同性外种群。

Conclusion: 彗星储层和星际物体是密集星团中行星-盘相互作用和恒星飞越的自然副产品，将外行星系统结构与它们的诞生环境联系起来。

Abstract: Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close
encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary
systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides
a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical
simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and
REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues
embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an
$Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either
an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form
Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk
interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar
encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with
ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for
encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to
distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,
and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar
encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys
redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer
populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that
cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of
planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the
architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.

### [2] [Giant Planet Evolution with MESA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23678)
*Ravit Helled,Simon Müller,Henrik Knierim*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 对MESA代码进行关键修改以增强其在巨行星建模中的适用性，包括引入针对行星条件的物态方程、改进辐射不透明度处理、优化对流混合过程以及添加氦雨沉降处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巨行星演化是一个受多种物理参数和过程影响的复杂过程，需要更精确的建模工具来理解太阳系内外的巨行星演化。

Method: 修改MESA代码：1) 引入针对行星条件的物态方程，考虑氢氦混合物和重元素的热力学性质；2) 改进辐射不透明度以模拟颗粒、云层和不透明度窗口；3) 优化对流混合过程以更好地处理成分梯度；4) 添加氦雨沉降处理。

Result: 这些修改提高了MESA在巨行星演化建模中的预测能力，代码已公开可用。

Conclusion: 这些改进有望促进对太阳系内外巨行星演化的更深入理解。

Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various
physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical
modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)
code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an
equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions.
The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium
mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure
calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow
the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the
treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective
mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment
for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive
capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We
hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant
planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.

### [3] [Rheological Lunar Regolith Simulants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23680)
*Léonie Gasteiner,Alyona Glazyrina,Naomi Murdoch,Olfa D'Angelo*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强月球模拟月壤粘聚力的方法，使其机械性能更接近真实月球环境下的月壤特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有月壤模拟物的物理特性与真实月球土壤存在差异，特别是在低重力环境下，真实月壤的粘聚力明显更高。

Method: 采用标准化岩土剪切试验评估增强模拟物的机械行为，并在Mohr-Coulomb模型框架下分析摩擦角和粘聚力。

Result: 大多数模拟物的摩擦角接近真实月壤，但粘聚力在月球环境下更高。提出的增强方法能有效提高模拟物的粘聚力。

Conclusion: 通过增强粘聚力的方法，可以开发出更准确模拟真实月球环境机械性能的月壤模拟物。

Abstract: Regolith simulants are essential for space research and technology
development. Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true
planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ, that
experience notably reduced gravity.
  We focus on lunar regolith simulants and explore various techniques to modify
existing simulants to replicate the mechanical/rheological behavior of Moon
regolith in true lunar conditions. Our results are validated against data from
in-situ tests conducted during the Luna and Apollo missions, enabling a direct
comparison of physical properties of our enhanced simulants to true Lunar
regolith, on the Moon. Analyzed in the Mohr-Coulomb model framework, the
friction angle of most simulants is generally close to that of true regolith,
but the measured cohesion is often higher on the Moon, notably due to the
reduced gravity environment. We propose a method to increase the cohesion of an
existing simulant and assess the mechanical behavior of our rheological
regolith simulant using a standardized geotechnical, shear test. The
experimental results are then directly compared to in-situ data, providing a
quantitative basis for evaluating the fidelity of the enhanced simulants.

### [4] [Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23708)
*Ritvik Sai Narayan,Melinda Soares-Furtado,Mary Anne Limbach,Nishanth Ramanujam,Andrew Vanderburg,Johanna M. Vos*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 评估南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜对玫瑰星云进行凌星巡天的预期发现量，预测在1个月巡天中可探测到33±9颗年轻系外行星，在2周巡天中可探测到29±8颗，主要为1-2地球半径的超级地球和亚海王星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年轻恒星中已知系外行星数量很少，但测量这些年龄的行星至关重要，因为这是驱动行星迁移的动力过程最活跃的阶段。玫瑰星云是一个约1000万年的恒星形成区，具有密集多样的恒星种群。

Method: 使用罗曼曝光时间计算器量化对玫瑰星云成员的灵敏度，建立伴星探测阈值，并通过蒙特卡洛注入-恢复模拟评估发现量。

Result: 预测在1个月巡天中探测到33±9颗年轻凌星系外行星，在2周巡天中探测到29±8颗。探测主要受限于1-2地球半径的超级地球和亚海王星，轨道周期小于8天。

Conclusion: 这样的样本将大幅扩展目前仅有的3颗年龄小于2000万年行星的普查，探测行星半径仍膨胀、近轨道稳定性不确定且行星迁移可能仍在进行的年龄阶段，为早期行星演化提供约束并为后续观测建立优先目标。

Abstract: Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population
because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent
placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet,
measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when
dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess
the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit
survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with
a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time
Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection
thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo
injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young
transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29
\pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves
sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf
detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal
baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths
and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially
expand the census of only three detected planets younger than
$20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain
inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary
migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early
planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb
Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

### [5] [Sensitivity to Sub-Io-sized Exosatellite Transits in the MIRI LRS Lightcurve of the Nearest Substellar Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23709)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用JWST/MIRI LRS对WISE J1049-5319AB褐矮星双星系统进行8小时光度监测，采用新型双波段同时搜索方法寻找系外卫星，未发现显著凌星信号，但证明了探测小至0.275地球半径卫星的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST前所未有的灵敏度为探测亚恒星世界的系外卫星提供了机会，这些卫星可能像太阳系巨行星的卫星一样丰富。

Method: 使用JWST/MIRI LRS进行8小时光度监测，采用同时双波段搜索方法来处理宿主星变异性问题。

Result: 未检测到统计显著的凌星信号，但注入恢复测试显示可探测小至0.275地球半径（约1个月球半径）的卫星，对应300ppm的凌星深度。

Conclusion: 该方法为探测直接成像褐矮星、自由漂浮行星和宽轨道系外行星周围的类伽利略卫星类似物铺平了道路，JWST现在探测的区域预计此类伴星很丰富。

Abstract: JWST's unprecedented sensitivity enables precise spectrophotometric
monitoring of substellar worlds, revealing atmospheric variability driven by
mechanisms operating across different pressure levels. This same precision now
permits exceptionally sensitive searches for transiting exosatellites, small
terrestrial companions to these worlds. Using a novel simultaneous dual-band
search method to address host variability, we present a search for transiting
exosatellites in an 8-hour JWST/MIRI LRS lightcurve of the nearby ($2.0\,pc$)
substellar binary WISE J1049-5319AB, composed of two $\sim30 M_{\rm Jup}$ brown
dwarfs separated by $3.5\,au$ and viewed near edge-on. Although we detect no
statistically significant transits, our injection-recovery tests demonstrate
sensitivity to satellites as small as $0.275\,R_{\oplus}$ ($0.96\,R_{\rm Io}$
or $\sim$1 lunar radius), corresponding to 300ppm transit depths, and
satellite-to-host mass ratios $>$$10^{-6}$. This approach paves the way for
detecting Galilean-moon analogs around directly imaged brown dwarfs,
free-floating planets, and wide-orbit exoplanets, dozens of which are already
scheduled for JWST lightcurve monitoring. In our Solar System, each giant
planet hosts on average 3.5 moons above this threshold, suggesting that JWST
now probes a regime where such companions are expected to be abundant. The
technique and sensitivities demonstrated here mark a critical step toward
detecting exosatellites and ultimately enabling constraints on the occurrence
rates of small terrestrial worlds orbiting $1\text{-}70$$M_{\rm Jup}$ hosts.

### [6] [The Dynamical Environment within the Habitable Zone of the Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 Planetary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23792)
*Stephen R. Kane*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 对Gaia-4和Gaia-5系外行星系统进行动力学分析，发现高偏心率的巨行星会破坏宜居带内行星的轨道稳定性，影响直接成像任务的目标选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多已知行星系统不经过主恒星，只能测量行星的最小质量，难以全面评估系统内的动力学环境。天体测量学可以解决质量模糊问题，从而对系统进行更完整的动力学分析。

Method: 使用径向速度数据和盖亚任务数据，对Gaia-4和Gaia-5系统进行动力学分析，包括宜居带计算和行星-行星散射事件诊断。

Result: 已知伴星的存在基本排除了宜居带内存在行星的可能性，高偏心率的巨行星会严重破坏类地行星的轨道完整性。

Conclusion: 这些"破坏球"系统对计划中的直接成像任务的目标选择产生影响，这些任务旨在识别潜在宜居环境。

Abstract: Exoplanetary systems exhibit a broad range of architectures which, in turn,
enable a variety of dynamical environments. Many of the known planetary systems
do not transit the host star, and so we measure the minimum masses of their
planets, making it difficult to fully assess the dynamical environment within
the system. Astrometry can resolve the mass ambiguity and thus allow a more
complete dynamical analysis of systems to be conducted. Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 are
two such systems, whose study with radial velocities and data from the Gaia
mission revealed that each star harbors a massive planet on a highly eccentric
orbit. In this work, we provide the results of a dynamical analysis of each
system, including calculations of the Habitable Zone (HZ), from which we show
that the presence of the known companions largely exclude the presence of
planets within the HZ. We discuss the diagnostics of potential past
planet-planet scattering events, and the occurrence of similar systems whereby
a giant planet on an eccentric orbit can substantially disrupt orbital
integrity of terrestrial planets. These "wrecking ball" systems have an impact
on the target selection for planned direct imaging missions that seek to
identify potentially habitable environments.

### [7] [Wind-AE: A Fast, Open-source 1D Photoevaporation Code with Metal and Multi-frequency X-ray Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23857)
*Madelyn Broome,Ruth Murray-Clay,John McCann,James E Owen*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发了一个开源的一维多频XUV光蒸发模型，用于研究系外行星大气质量损失。模型显示金属丰度降低质量损失率，而X射线增加质量损失率，净效应类似但产生更热、更快、更渐变的电离风。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短周期系外行星(<100天)经历X射线和极紫外辐射，驱动大气外流和质量损失，这对行星演化和观测统计很重要，但目前质量损失率无法直接观测，只能通过模型推断。

Method: 基于Murray-Clay等人的工作，开发了开源的一维多频XUV、多组分、稳态流体动力学Parker Wind光蒸发弛豫模型，能够平滑处理高低通量状态，并接受自定义多频恒星光谱。

Result: 对于典型热木星如HD 209458b，XUV风发射半径约为1.1-1.8倍行星半径，能量限制质量损失率在行星半径处计算是良好近似；但对于低逃逸速度行星，风发射半径远大于行星半径，必须在风发射半径处计算以避免低估质量损失率。

Conclusion: 需要根据行星类型和通量条件选择适当的计算半径：低逃逸速度行星需在风发射半径处计算质量损失率，而高逃逸速度或大入射通量情况下需考虑辐射冷却效应以避免高估质量损失率。

Abstract: Throughout their lives, short period exoplanets (<100 days) experience X-ray
and extreme-UV (XUV) stellar irradiation that can heat and photoionize planets'
upper atmospheres, driving transonic outflows. This photoevaporative mass loss
plays a role in both evolution and observed demographics; however, mass loss
rates are not currently directly observable and can only be inferred from
models. To that end, we present an open-source fast 1D, XUV multi-frequency,
multispecies, steady-state, hydrodynamic Parker Wind photoevaporation
relaxation model based on Murray-Clay et al. (2009,arXiv:0811.0006). The model
can move smoothly between high and low flux regimes and accepts custom
multi-frequency stellar spectra. While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays
increases mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\dot{M}$, and the net
result for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster,
and more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g.,
13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere
resulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for
all but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity
atmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b,
$R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass
loss rate, $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation.
However, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and
super-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be >>$R_P$, making it necessary to use
$\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss
rates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative
cooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\dot{M}$.

### [8] [Lunar Navigation System Optimization for Targeted Coverage with Semi-Analytical Station Keeping Model and Earth-GPS Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24084)
*Rameez A. Malik,Yang Yang*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 提出基于进化多目标优化的月球导航卫星系统设计框架，整合高精度轨道传播模型，实现用6颗卫星达到90%南极覆盖，年dV需求低于0.4 km/s。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LNSS设计主要关注全球覆盖，使用低精度分析模型；南极研究局限于椭圆冻结轨道；缺乏与地球GNSS集成的全面优化方法。

Method: 采用进化多目标优化结合高精度数值月球轨道传播模型，同时考虑南极导航性能、半解析连续轨道保持模型和GPS-LNSS集成参数。

Result: 优化发现多种非冻结椭圆轨道方案，仅用6颗卫星即可实现90%以上南极覆盖，年dV需求低于0.4 km/s，相比之前研究显著减少星座规模。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了平衡覆盖、精度和dV需求的多样化LNSS配置，为未来月球导航任务提供了成本效益高且操作高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The design of an indigenous Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is
receiving growing attention due to the surge in planned lunar missions and the
limited accessibility of Earth-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
in the cislunar environment. Several studies have explored LNSS architecture
using geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing
LNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using
analytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south
pole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs)
and lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with
Earth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not
been adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a
comprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary
multi-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar
orbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation
performance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous
station-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS
integration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse
set of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV
requirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen
elliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with
acceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less
than 0.4 km/s per satellite per year. This represents a significant reduction
in constellation size compared to previous studies, offering a cost-effective
yet operationally efficient solution for future LNSS missions.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文开发了理论框架分析海神行星上的湿润对流抑制效应，发现这种行星具有复杂的多稳态和振荡气候动态，对先前关于K2-18b可居住性的结论提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海神行星是系外行星搜索的重要目标，但现有1D模型未考虑对流抑制效应，导致对其气候特征理解不足。

Method: 开发了纸笔理论分析湿润对流抑制效应，并用1D辐射-对流模型进行验证。

Result: 发现海神行星在抑制层附近可呈现双稳态或振荡，而较热行星则呈现多稳态，抑制层内的水循环受多种过程影响。

Conclusion: 海神行星具有意想不到的丰富气候动态，先前关于其可居住性和海洋推断的结论需要更自洽的模型验证。

Abstract: Hycean planets are hypothetical exoplanets characterized by $H_2O$ oceans and
$H_2$-rich atmospheres. These planets are high-priority targets for
biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with
easy-to-characterize $H_2$-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate
feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet's
temperature structure. However, so far hycean planets have mostly been
investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and
its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper
theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets.
The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative-convective model. We
show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit
either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer's trapping of
heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in
which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria
due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer.
The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes
that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion,
convective overshoot and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that
hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous
claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with
more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b
might be habitable, and the proposal to infer $H_2O$ oceans on sub-Neptunes
from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.

### [10] [What is the nature of late infall streamers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24269)
*L. -A. Hühn,C. P. Dullemond*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过3D流体动力学模拟发现，原行星盘可以通过与周围气体云的相互作用或湍流环境自然形成流束结构，这些流束的形态和数量受环境条件影响，为理解行星形成环境提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测证据表明II类原行星盘可能通过晚期吸积与环境相互作用，形成连接大尺度气体结构与盘尺度的流束结构，这对孤立演化盘的传统行星形成理论提出了挑战。

Method: 使用基于网格的FARGO3D代码进行3D流体动力学模拟，并使用蒙特卡洛辐射传输代码RADMC3D进行后处理以获得合成观测结果。

Result: 发现单次气体云相遇产生的流束寿命较短（约10 kyr），但在湍流环境中可自然形成多个共存流束，流束形态对环境条件有显著依赖性。

Conclusion: 流束结构不仅可通过与气体云相互作用形成，也能在湍流环境中自然产生，其形态特征可用于约束行星形成盘周围气体的物理条件。

Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks
may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late
infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of
so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended
gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching
consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing
treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the
emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their
morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental
conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical
simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain
synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.
We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with
a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the
fall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a
timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form
naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such
encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous
detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for
a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of
$v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity
dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find
considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which
may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas
surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which
planets form.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用JWST观测自由漂浮行星WISE 0855以寻找系外卫星，虽然未发现卫星凌星证据，但证明JWST具备探测类木卫质量系外卫星的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST正在观测自由漂浮行星以研究其天气，这些光变曲线也是寻找系外卫星凌星的理想数据集。

Method: 分析11小时的JWST NIRSpec时域光谱数据，结合高斯过程建模区分卫星凌星与行星自身变率，进行人工凌星注入和恢复测试。

Result: 未发现显著的系外卫星凌星证据，但对深度≥0.5%的凌星探测率达到96%，相当于探测类似土卫六质量的卫星。

Conclusion: JWST对数十个自由漂浮行星的观测可有效约束系外卫星的出现率，这是首次证明JWST能探测自由漂浮行星周围的类木卫质量卫星。

Abstract: JWST is collecting time-series observations of many free-floating planets
(FFPs) to study their weather, but these light curves are the ideal datasets to
search for exomoons that transit the FFP during observations. In this paper, we
present observations of the planetary-mass Y dwarf ($T=250-285K$, $M =
6.5\pm3.5 M_{Jup}$, d = 2.3$\,$pc) WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), whose
proximity and brightness make it ideal for a transiting exomoon search. We
examine 11 hours of time-series spectra from the JWST Near-Infrared
Spectrograph (NIRSpec) whose sensitivity, in combination with Gaussian process
(GP) modeling, allows for the disentanglement of exomoon transits from WISE
0855's variability. We do not find statistically significant evidence of an
exomoon transit in this dataset. Using injection and recovery tests of
artificial transits for depths ranging between 0.1-1% (0.35-1.12 $R_{\oplus}$)
we explore the exomoon parameter space where we could successfully detect
transits. For transit depths $\geq 0.5\%$ (1.96$\,R_{\text{Titan}}$), our
detection rate is 96%, which, for WISE 0855, corresponds to a moon with a
companion-to-host mass ratio similar to that of Titan and Saturn. Given our
sensitivity, transit probabilities, and our observational duration, we
determine a $\sim$91% probability of detecting a Titan mass analog exomoon
after 18 such observations if every observed system hosts a Titan mass analog
exomoon in a Galilean-like system. This suggests that JWST observations of
dozens of FFPs could yield meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of
exomoons. This paper is the first demonstration that JWST is sensitive to
Galilean moon mass analogs around FFPs.

Method: 使用基于太阳系发展的理论模型，分析系外行星周围的环-卫星循环过程，模拟不同角度下环截面的几何形状，并与行星凌星截面进行比较。

Result: 发现海王星类和地球类行星周围的环-卫星循环能够产生与土星环相当甚至更大的相对凌星深度，多行星系统中的长期自转-轨道共振可为这些环提供必要的行星倾角。

Conclusion: 环-卫星系统可能是解释某些观测异常（如异常低密度）的可行机制，同时指出了现有系外行星扁率计算中存在的不一致性问题。

Abstract: The presence of rings and moons around exoplanets is likely to be one of the
next great discoveries in exoplanet research. Using theories developed for the
Solar System, we explore the possibility of coupled ring-moon cycles around
exoplanets and what these processes mean for the observability of these
features. Around Neptune- and Earth-like planets, we find that ring-moon cycles
are capable of producing long-lived rings of comparable and greater relative
transit depths than Saturn's. In multi-planet systems, secular spin-orbit
resonances can provide the necessary planetary obliquity for these rings to
contribute noticeably to transit lightcurves. We model the geometry of a ring's
cross-section at various angles in comparison to the cross-section of a
transiting planet to determine whether the ring may be detectable during the
planet's transit. Ringed planets have also been proposed as an alternative to
inflated planetary radii seen in transit, leading to abnormally low observed
densities. Ring-moon cycles can produce late-forming and sometimes long-lived
rings that can have the potential of explaining at least some of these
observations. We also discuss some inconsistencies in the calculation of
exoplanet oblateness due to rotation that we have come across in the course of
this work.

Motivation: 超热木星的大气温度和化学组成预计会随经度、纬度和高度变化，但以往观测只能获得半球积分光谱，无法精确探测大气梯度。

Method: 使用JWST的NIRISS仪器观测WASP-18b的二次食，通过光谱映射技术解析大气层在多个维度的特征。

Result: 发现比理论预测更弱的经向温度梯度；识别出两个热学特征区域：围绕亚恒星点的"热点"区域和靠近昼侧边缘的"环"区域；热点区域呈现强烈倒置的热结构。

Conclusion: 氢解离和/或夜侧云层在塑造全球热辐射中起重要作用；类似分析方法将揭示各类系外行星大气的三维热学、化学和动力学特性。

Abstract: Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as "ultra-hot Jupiters" are
anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric temperature and
chemistry as a function of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Previous
observations have hinted at these variations, but the existing data have been
fundamentally restricted to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby
providing only coarse information on atmospheric gradients. Here we present a
spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar planet, resolving the atmosphere in
multiple dimensions simultaneously. We analyze a secondary eclipse of the
ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b observed with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The
mapping reveals weaker longitudinal temperature gradients than were predicted
by theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen dissociation
and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal emission. Additionally, we
identify two thermally distinct regions of the planet's atmosphere: a "hotspot"
surrounding the substellar point and a "ring" near the dayside limbs. The
hotspot region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due to the presence
of optical absorbers and a water abundance marginally lower than the
hemispheric average, in accordance with theoretical predictions. The ring
region shows colder temperatures and poorly constrained chemical abundances.
Similar future analyses will reveal three-dimensional thermal, chemical, and
dynamical properties of a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres.
