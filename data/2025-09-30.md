### [1] [Re-accretion of Giant Impact Ejecta Can Drive Significant Atmospheric Erosion on Terrestrial Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22785)
*Tuhin Ghosh,Mark Wyatt,Oliver Shorttle*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究揭示了巨撞击后碎片再吸积对类地行星大气演化的关键影响，发现二次撞击会显著增强大气侵蚀，特别是月球形成撞击的碎片可在约3000万年内侵蚀掉现今地球规模的大气。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值模拟因计算成本限制只关注巨撞击的即时后果，忽略了碎片再吸积这一长期过程对大气演化的影响，需要研究这一被忽视的机制。

Method: 通过追踪巨撞击中喷射碎片的碰撞和动力学演化，量化碎片再吸积到母行星上的数量，分析二次撞击对大气侵蚀的影响。

Result: 发现约0.003地球质量的碎片会被再吸积，二次撞击导致显著的大气损失，月球形成撞击的碎片可在30Myr内侵蚀掉现今地球规模的大气。

Conclusion: 巨撞击碎片再吸积在类地行星长期大气演化中起关键作用，当考虑碎片再吸积时，巨撞击对大气侵蚀的效果比之前认为的要强得多。

Abstract: Giant impacts, the collisions between planetary embryos, play a crucial role
in sculpting the planets and their orbital architectures. Numerical simulations
have advanced our understanding of these events, enabling estimations of mass
and atmospheric loss during the primary impacts. However, high computational
costs have restricted investigations to the immediate aftermath, limiting our
understanding of the longer-term consequences. In this study, we investigate
the effect of re-accretion of giant impact debris, a process previously
overlooked, on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Following the
collisional and dynamical evolution of the debris ejected during the primary
impacts, we quantify the amount of debris that would be re-accreted by the
progenitor. We find that $\sim 0.003\ M_{\oplus}$ would be re-accreted over a
wide range of Earth-like planet properties, assuming $1\%$ of their mass is
ejected as non-vaporised debris. Over a prolonged period, the secondary impacts
during re-accretion drive enhanced atmospheric loss. Notably, the impacts from
the debris of the canonical Moon-forming impact would have gradually eroded an
atmosphere similar to present-day Earth's in $\sim 30$ Myr. More generally, any
planet growing via giant impacts within $2$ au is likely to experience
significant post-impact atmospheric erosion unless the initial atmosphere was
at least $5$ times more massive than Earth's. Our results highlight the crucial
role secondary impacts from giant-impact ejecta could have in driving the
long-term atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets, and demonstrate that
giant impacts can be significantly more effective at eroding such atmospheres
than previously thought, when re-accretion of debris is considered.

### [2] [Ross 458c: Gas Giant or Brown Dwarf?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22803)
*William W. Meynardie,Michael R. Meyer,Ryan J. MacDonald,Per Calissendorff,Elijah Mullens,Gabriel Munoz Zarazua,Anuranj Roy,Hansica Ganta,Eileen C. Gonzales,Arthur Adams,Nikole Lewis,Yucian Hong,Jonathan Lunine*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过JWST观测Ross 458c的近红外光谱，分析其大气成分以推断形成历史。模型拟合显示其金属丰度可能高于宿主星，但反演结果与宿主星一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Ross 458c的形成机制，通过比较其与宿主星的大气成分来区分是分子云湍流碎裂形成还是盘内形成后迁移。

Method: 使用JWST NIRSpec获取高分辨率发射光谱，采用前向模型网格（Sonora Bobcat、Sonora Elf Owl、ExoREM）和大气反演（POSEIDON）拟合光谱，同时用PHOENIX模型分析宿主星光谱。

Result: 前向模型网格倾向于Ross 458c具有比宿主星更高的金属丰度，但反演结果显示其金属丰度与宿主星在1σ范围内一致。

Conclusion: 研究为Ross 458c的形成历史提供了新见解，并比较了前向模型网格与反演方法在直接成像伴星大气特性分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Ross 458c is a widely separated planetary mass companion at a distance of
1100 AU from its host binary, Ross 458AB. It is a member of a class of very
low-mass companions at distances of hundreds to thousands of AU from their host
stars. We aim to constrain Ross 458c's formation history by fitting its near-IR
spectrum to models to constrain its composition. If its composition is similar
to its host star, we infer that it likely formed through turbulent
fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that formed the host. If its
composition is enhanced in heavy elements relative to the host, this lends
evidence to formation in the disk and subsequent migration to its current
separation. Here, we present high-resolution (R$\sim$2700) emission spectra of
Ross 458c with JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit in the F070LP, F100LP, and F170LP
filters from 0.8 to 3.1 $\mu$m. We fit these spectra using both grids of
forward models (Sonora Bobcat, Sonora Elf Owl, and ExoREM) and atmospheric
retrievals (POSEIDON). We also constrain the composition of Ross 458AB by
fitting an archival SpeX spectrum with PHOENIX forward models. The forward
model grids prefer an enhanced atmospheric metallicity for Ross 458c relative
to the host, but our retrievals return a metallicity consistent with the host
within 1$\sigma$. Our results offer new insights into the formation history of
Ross 458c, as well as the efficacy of fitting forward model grids versus
retrievals to derive atmospheric properties of directly imaged companions.

### [3] [Testing the Impact of Planet-stirring, Self-stirring, and Mixed-stirring on Debris Disc Architecture: A Case Study of HD 16743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22822)
*Jonathan P. Marshall,Marco A. Muñoz-Gutiérrez,Antranik A. Sefilian,Antonio Peimbert*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用N体模拟研究HD 16743碎片盘系统，通过毫米波观测分析行星或大质量星子对盘结构的激发机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过高分辨率毫米波观测探测碎片盘的径向和垂直结构，推断未观测到行星伴星对碎片盘的影响。

Method: 进行N体动力学模拟，考虑单一行星伴星和/或嵌入大质量星子的相对贡献，模拟ALMA毫米波观测。

Result: 发现一组位于相对窄半长轴范围内、具有轻微偏心轨道的大质量星子能最好地再现观测到的发射垂直和径向范围。

Conclusion: 对于HD 16743系统，星子自激发机制比行星激发机制更能解释观测到的碎片盘结构。

Abstract: Dynamical interactions between planets and debris discs can excite the orbits
of embedded planetesimals to such a degree that a collisional cascade is
triggered, generating detectable amounts of dust. Millimetre wavelength
observations are sensitive to emission from large and cold dust grains, which
are unperturbed by radiation forces and act as a proxy for the location of the
planetesimals. The influence of unseen planetary companions on debris discs can
be inferred with high-resolution imaging observations at millimetre
wavelengths, tracing the radial and vertical structure of these belts. Here we
present a set of dynamical $N$-body simulations modelling ALMA
millimetre-wavelength observations of the HD 16743 debris disc system. In these
simulations, we consider a range of relative contributions from either a single
planetary companion and/or a set of embedded massive planetesimals to reproduce
the disc's observed radial and vertical structure. We compare our dynamical
results for the limiting cases of planet-stirring and self-stirring, finding
them to be consistent with theoretical expectations for each scenario. For the
case of HD 16743, we find that a set of massive planetesimals on mildly
eccentric orbits, confined to a relatively narrow range of semimajor axes
(compared to the observed belt width), offers the best results to reproduce the
vertical and radial extent of the observed emission.

### [4] [Shedding Light on Desert Dwellers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22893)
*Tim Hallatt,Sarah Millholland*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文提出热木星的潮汐破坏可以解释亚木星沙漠中行星的起源，通过低效角动量转移的潮汐驱动洛希瓣溢流机制，这些残余行星应该表现出可观测的潮汐衰减速率和宿主星快速旋转等特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚木星沙漠中的行星密度高、质量大且围绕富金属恒星运行，但其起源仍然神秘。研究者希望验证这些行星是否来自热木星的潮汐破坏残余。

Method: 通过分析沙漠行星宿主星的银河系运动学特征，并模拟潮汐驱动的洛希瓣溢流过程，特别关注角动量转移效率对行星残余特性的影响。

Result: 研究发现低效角动量转移的洛希瓣溢流可以产生与观测相符的沙漠行星，这些行星应该以约0.5毫秒/年的速率潮汐衰减，其宿主星可能比场星旋转快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 如果观测证实这些预测，亚木星沙漠中的行星可以作为研究巨行星内部结构的独特工具，揭示了热木星潮汐破坏是沙漠行星形成的重要机制。

Abstract: The ``sub-Jovian desert" ($2{\lesssim}R_{\rm p}{\lesssim}10 \ R_{\oplus}$,
periods $\lesssim$3 days) is sparsely populated but no longer empty. Recent
surveys have revealed that planets residing in the desert are dense
(${\rho}{\gtrsim}1$ g/cm$^{3}$), massive ($\sim$10${-}$50 $M_{\oplus}$), and
orbit metal-rich stars that are indistinguishable from those hosting hot
Jupiters. However, their origins remain mysterious. In this work we adopt and
test the hypothesis that tidal destruction of hot Jupiters can populate the
sub-Jovian desert with stripped remnant planets. We first show that stars
hosting desert dwellers exhibit Galactic kinematics indicative of an older
population descended from those hosting hot Jupiters. We highlight that
tidally-driven Roche lobe overflow (RLO) can indeed populate the desert with
planets similar to those observed, but only if angular momentum transfer during
RLO is inefficient (``lossy" RLO). The entire width of the sub-Jovian desert
can be backfilled with the remnants of hot Jupiters that possessed their
empirically inferred spread in entropy. In this picture, current desert
dwellers such as LTT 9779b should be tidally decaying at an observationally
testable rate of ${\sim}0.5$ ms/yr. Our theory also predicts that desert
dweller host stars may rotate up to an order of magnitude more rapidly than
field stars; rotation period differences may persist ${\sim}$Gyr after RLO.
Lossy RLO may also manifest as a burst of IR excess that could outshine the
host star for up to ${\sim}10^{3}$ yr. If these predictions are confirmed by
observations, our theory indicates that desert dwellers can be leveraged to
study the interiors of giant planets in exquisite detail.

### [5] [Induced-Flare Candidates from the TESS Mission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22918)
*Nathan Whitsett,Tansu Daylan*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发了ARDOR管道来探测行星诱导的耀斑，发现了TOI-1062b和Gliese 49b两个候选系统，其耀斑活动与行星近星点位置相关，表明可能存在行星磁场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究行星磁场对行星大气保留的影响，特别是半径辐照谷现象（1.5-2.0地球半径行星稀少）可能与行星磁场有关。

Method: 构建ARDOR管道，使用物理驱动的恒星-行星相互作用前向模型，在时序光度数据中探测和表征行星诱导的耀斑，并进行注入-恢复模拟验证灵敏度。

Result: 发现TOI-1062b系统在近星点处有显著耀斑活动（p=2.2×10^-5，5.1σ），Gliese 49b系统有中等显著性的耀斑聚集（2.5σ）。

Conclusion: TOI-1062b和Gliese 49b是行星诱导耀斑的有希望候选者，需要后续射电和紫外观测来确认行星磁场的存在。

Abstract: The empirical underabundance of close-in planets with radii 1.5-2.0 times
that of the Earth, referred to as the radius irradiation valley, may be linked
to the inability of gas dwarfs under certain conditions to retain their
volatile envelopes due to photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. In either
case, the extent to which a planet can preserve its atmosphere critically
depends on poorly understood planetary magnetism. An effective probe of
planetary magnetic fields is the interaction between a star and its close-in
planet, where the planet magnetically interacts with its host, inducing flares
as it moves near its periastron within the Alfv\'en surface of its host star.
We construct a pipeline, \textsc{ardor}, to detect and characterize potentially
planet-induced flares in time-series photometric data using a physically
motivated forward model of star-planet interactions, with a focus on recovering
flares located near the noise floor. We perform extensive injection-recovery
simulations to determine our sensitivity to flares correlating with the
planetary phase over a range of stellar types and orbital architectures. We
identify one close-in, eccentric ($e=0.18$) system, TOI-1062\,b, which exhibits
flaring during periastron consistent with being induced with
$p_{KS}=2.2\times10^{-5}$ and a $5.1\sigma$ detection through unbinned
likelihood analysis and goodness-of-fit tests. We also identify an additional
eccentric ($e=0.363$) candidate, Gliese 49b, which exhibits moderately
significant ($2.5\sigma$) flare clustering at periastron, requiring additional
photometric observations to confirm its significance. TOI-1062b and Gliese 49b
are promising candidates for induced flares, underscoring the need for radio
and UV follow-up observations.

### [6] [Coupled Planetary Interior and Tidal Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22923)
*Tim Hallatt,Sarah Millholland*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发了一个新的行星结构/热演化模型，用于耦合轨道动力学与行星结构的研究。该模型与MESA恒星演化代码基准测试结果一致，并应用于研究海王星类行星的高偏心率迁移历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究海王星类行星在"山脊"区域（周期3-6天）的形成机制，特别是通过高偏心率迁移（HEM）过程的可能性，以及避免潮汐膨胀失控的条件。

Method: 开发新的行星结构/热演化模型，与MESA代码进行基准测试验证，然后应用于分析海王星类行星的潮汐迁移历史，考虑不同金属丰度和潮汐品质因子的影响。

Result: 发现很难在不引发失控潮汐膨胀和大气破坏的情况下在"山脊"区域形成圆化的海王星；低偏心率海王星只能通过HEM形成，但需要金属富集和精细调节的潮汐品质因子。

Conclusion: 如果观测确认低偏心率海王星确实通过HEM形成且金属富集不强，则其潮汐加热机制必须在行星上层区域运行以避免失控膨胀。重力模式激发是可能的候选机制，而核心摩擦或对流区湍流耗散可被排除。

Abstract: We present a new planetary structure/thermal evolution model, designed for
use in problems that couple orbital dynamics with planetary structure. We first
benchmark our structural/thermal evolution calculations against the
\texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, finding excellent agreement across a wide
range of planet mass, equilibrium temperature, entropy, and extra heating
deposited at various depths in the planet. We then apply our method to study
the tidal migration histories of Neptunes in the recently identified ``ridge"
(periods ${\sim}3{-}6$ days), a feature that has been suggested to be populated
via high eccentricity migration (HEM) of more distant Neptunes. We find that it
is difficult to form a circularized Neptune in the ridge without instigating
runaway tidal inflation and likely atmospheric destruction; low eccentricity
Neptunes in the ridge can only be emplaced by HEM if they are metal-rich and
exhibit finely-tuned tidal quality factors. If follow-up observations confirm
that low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge did arrive via HEM and are not
strongly enriched in metals, our calculations indicate that their tidal heating
mechanism must operate in the upper reaches of the planet to avoid runaway
inflation. Gravity modes excited in upper radiative layers are a possible
candidate mechanism, while friction in the core or turbulent dissipation in
convective zones could be ruled out.

### [7] [The Near-Infrared Spectral Characteristics of Water Ice, Epsomite, and Halite Mixtures Relevant to Europa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22927)
*Jodi Berdis,Carlie Wagoner,Akemi Takeuchi,Karl Hibbitts*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 首次发布水冰、泻利盐和岩盐颗粒混合物在低温下的近红外光谱，评估线性混合和亲密混合模型对实验室光谱数据的再现能力，发现小冰颗粒对2.0μm光谱特征影响更大，混合模型分析是确定材料组成和丰度的最可靠方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究水冰与其他矿物颗粒混合物在低温下的光谱特性，评估不同混合模型在光谱分析中的适用性，为天体光谱分析提供实验室依据。

Method: 在低温条件下测量水冰、泻利盐和岩盐颗粒混合物的近红外光谱，使用线性和亲密混合模型对实验数据进行定量评估和拟合分析。

Result: 小冰颗粒对2.0μm光谱特征的影响大于大冰颗粒；泻利盐和岩盐的大颗粒尺寸特征因饱和吸收而难以辨别；线性和亲密混合模型对纯水冰及水冰-泻利盐混合物的拟合效果相似，但在连续谱或吸收特征上仍存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 光谱分析可能存在对小冰颗粒的观测偏差，光谱混合分析是确定材料组成和丰度的最可靠方法；使用泻利盐光学常数数据时需注意潜在的低温数据错误。

Abstract: We publish the first NIR spectra of grain particulate mixtures of water ice,
epsomite, and halite at cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we perform a
quantitative assessment of the ability of both intimately- and linearly-mixed
models to reproduce laboratory data of different grain mixtures of water ice,
as well as water ice mixed with epsomite. We find that smaller grains of water
ice impart a stronger influence than larger grains of water ice on the 2.0
{\mu}m spectral feature in epsomite, and grain size signatures for both halite
and epsomite are challenging to discern for larger grain sizes as a result of
the saturated absorption features. These findings may indicate that an
observation bias toward smaller grain sizes of ice could exist, and that
quantitative assessments provided by spectral mixture analyses will be the most
reliable method for determining compositions and abundances of materials. We
also find that the linearly-mixed and intimately-mixed models of water ice
appear to match the laboratory spectra as expected, though still display some
inconsistencies, often either in the continuum or the absorption features. When
modeling pure water ice and water ice mixed with epsomite, no discernible
difference is observed between the fits of the linearly- and intimately-mixed
models. Future spectral mixture analyses that use epsomite should be aware of a
potential error in the published epsomite optical constant data, in which the
cryogenic data appear to be taken at ambient conditions.

### [8] [HARPS-N Reveals a Well-aligned Orbit for the Highly Eccentric Warm Jupiter TOI-4127 b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22972)
*Ismael Mireles,Felipe Murgas,Diana Dragomir,Enric Pallé,Jiayin Dong,Ilaria Carleo,Emma Esparza-Borges*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 测量了TOI-4127系统中暖木星TOI-4127 b的罗西特-麦克劳林效应，发现该高偏心率(e=0.75)行星与其宿主恒星良好对齐(λ=4° +17°/-16°)，这是目前已知最偏心率且对齐的系统之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解暖木星的形成机制及其与热木星的区别，因为暖木星轨道周期较长，潮汐重排时间尺度更长，任何不对齐现象都会持续存在。

Method: 使用HARPS-N光谱仪测量罗西特-麦克劳林效应，结合新的HARPS-N径向速度数据、存档的TESS测光数据以及NEID和SOPHIE径向速度数据对系统进行建模。

Result: 发现宿主恒星与高偏心率(e=0.75)暖木星TOI-4127 b良好对齐，天空投影倾角λ=4° +17°/-16°，这是已知最偏心率且对齐的系统之一，也是轨道周期最长的有倾角测量系统。

Conclusion: 该高偏心率且对齐轨道的起源仍是个谜，典型的原位形成和盘迁移无法解释，但行星与星盘共振相互作用、行星-行星散射、Kozai-Lidov振荡或共面高偏心率迁移等机制可能解释这一现象，但后两者需要系统中存在尚未探测到的另一颗行星。

Abstract: While many hot Jupiter systems have a measured obliquity, few warm Jupiter
systems do. The longer orbital periods and transit durations of warm Jupiters
make it more difficult to measure the obliquities of their host stars. However,
the longer periods also mean any misalignments persist due to the longer tidal
realignment timescales. As a result, measuring these obliquities is necessary
to understand how these types of planets form and how their formation and
evolution differ from that of hot Jupiters. Here, we report the measurement of
the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the TOI-4127 system using the HARPS-N
spectrograph. We model the system using our new HARPS-N radial velocity
measurements in addition to archival TESS photometry and NEID and SOPHIE radial
velocities. We find that the host star is well-aligned with the highly
eccentric (e=0.75) warm Jupiter TOI-4127 b, with a sky-projected obliquity
${\lambda} = {4^\circ}^{+17^\circ}_{-16^\circ}$. This makes TOI-4127 one of the
most eccentric well-aligned systems to date and one of the longest period
systems with a measured obliquity. Conclusions. The origin of its highly
eccentric yet well-aligned orbit remains a mystery, however, and we investigate
possible scenarios that could explain it. While typical in-situ formation and
disk migration scenarios cannot explain this system, certain scenarios
involving resonant interactions between the planet and protoplanetary disc
could. Similarly, specific cases of planet-planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov
oscillations can result in a highly-eccentric and well-aligned orbit. Coplanar
high-eccentricity migration could also explain this system. However, both this
mechanism and Kozai-Lidov oscillations require an additional planet in the
system that has not yet been detected.

TL;DR: 使用JWST数据和GCM模型研究M矮星周围暖木星WASP-80b的大气特征，发现无云模型能很好拟合观测数据，排除了特定类型的云颗粒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究M矮星周围暖木星的大气化学多样性，特别是云层对其反照率、热量分布和光谱特性的影响。

Method: 结合JWST全色发射和透射光谱数据，使用ADAM GCM模型（包含辐射活跃的示踪云模块）分析WASP-80b大气。

Result: 发射和透射光谱都能被无云GCM模型很好拟合；数据与大型云颗粒或所有尺寸的KCl云兼容；排除了0.1和1μm半径的Na2S凝结物。

Conclusion: 展示了全球建模在系外行星大气研究中的独特价值，为理解暖木星大气特征提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Close-in warm Jupiters orbiting M-dwarf stars are expected to exhibit diverse
atmospheric chemistry, with clouds playing a key role in shaping their albedo,
heat distribution, and spectral properties. We study WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter
orbiting an M-dwarf star, using the latest JWST panchromatic emission and
transmission spectra to comprehensively characterize its atmosphere, including
cloud coverage, chemical composition, and particle sizes, and compare the
observations with predictions from general circulation models (GCMs). We use a
General Circulation Model (GCM), ADAM (ADvanced Atmospheric MITgcm, formerly
known as SPARC/MITgcm), combined with the latest JWST data to study the
atmosphere of WASP-80b. A cloud module with radiatively active, tracer-based
clouds is integrated with the GCM to study the effects on the atmosphere and
the spectrum. Our results indicate that both emission and transmission spectra
are well fit by cloudless GCMs. The data appear to be compatible with large
cloud particles of any cloud species or KCl clouds of all particle sizes. The
Na$_2$S condensates of radii 0.1 and 1 $\mu$m can be ruled out due to the
strength of their radiative feedback. This showcases the unique insights that
can be obtained from global modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.

*Yuanheng Yang,Guo Chen,Hui Zhang,Fei Yan*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 首次在超热木星KELT-9b的昼侧大气中探测到OH分子，并确认了Fe的存在，通过自洽反演约束了元素丰度和金属丰度，为行星形成和迁移提供了线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同时测量挥发性和难熔元素对于追踪超热木星的形成和迁移至关重要，特别是在KELT-9b这样大气几乎完全解离和电离的最热行星上，此前尚未有分子被明确探测到。

Method: 使用SPIROU光谱仪进行两次热发射观测，在化学平衡条件下进行自洽反演，约束元素丰度和金属丰度。

Result: 探测到OH分子并确认Fe存在，氧丰度与太阳到超太阳值一致，C/O比和金属丰度为亚太阳到太阳值，热反转层得到确认，未发现显著多普勒频移。

Conclusion: 结果提供了挥发物富集的初步证据，与在水雪线外形成后向内迁移的假设兼容，未来JWST观测将提供更精确的丰度约束。

Abstract: Simultaneous measurements of volatile and refractory elements are essential
for tracing the formation and migration of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs).
High-resolution infrared emission spectroscopy has been widely used to probe
their atmospheres, covering molecules and atoms. For the hottest known planet,
KELT-9b, whose dayside atmosphere is nearly fully dissociated and ionized, no
molecules had been firmly detected. Here we report the first detection of OH in
the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b, based on two thermal emission observations
with the SPIRou spectrograph, and confirm the presence of Fe. We performed a
self-consistent retrieval under chemical equilibrium, constraining elemental
abundances and metallicity. A significant thermal inversion layer is confirmed.
No significant Doppler shifts were found, and the retrieved equatorial rotation
matches the tidally locked value. The oxygen abundance is consistent with solar
to supersolar (0.61$_{-0.58}^{+1.19}$ dex), while the C/O ratio and metallicity
are subsolar to solar. The low metallicity may indicate a well-mixed envelope
and interior. Constraints remain broad, and the data are consistent with
supersolar C/O and subsolar O. Combined [C/O] and [O/H] are compatible with
formation beyond the water snowline followed by inward migration, though other
scenarios cannot be excluded. Volatile-to-refractory ratios, [O/Fe] =
1.25$_{-0.74}^{+0.99}$ dex and [C/Fe] = 0.60$_{-0.74}^{+0.62}$ dex, lie in the
solar to supersolar range, but uncertainties limit firm conclusions. Results
provide tentative evidence for volatile enrichment. Future high-resolution
optical-to-infrared spectra with JWST will enable more precise abundance
constraints and stronger insights into UHJ formation and migration. We also
advocate a retrieval-guided cross-correlation strategy to reduce risk of
missing marginal detections, as illustrated by tentative evidence for CO.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析开普勒系外行星的轨道偏心率，发现位于银河系厚盘中的单行星系统比薄盘中的单行星系统具有更高的轨道偏心率，而多行星系统则无此差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究银河系薄盘和厚盘中的行星轨道动力学差异，以了解恒星和银河系环境因素如何影响行星形成和演化路径。

Method: 利用光偏心率效应约束开普勒行星样本的轨道偏心率，结合盖亚天体测量数据、银河系相空间信息和基于恒星化学丰度校准的运动学盘标准，概率性地将每个行星宿主与银河系薄盘或厚盘关联。

Result: 单行星系统中，厚盘行星比薄盘行星表现出更高的偏心率，而多行星系统则无此差异。这种差异不太可能仅由宿主恒星金属丰度或巨行星出现率引起。

Conclusion: 银河系运动学环境对行星轨道偏心率有显著影响，特别是在单行星系统中。需要综合分析来区分这些结果与恒星年龄等星-行星关系的未知影响。

Abstract: The orbital eccentricity distribution of exoplanets is shaped by a
combination of dynamical processes, reflecting both formation conditions and
long-term evolution. Probing the orbital dynamics of planets in the kinematic
thin and thick Galactic disks provides insight into the degree to which stellar
and Galactic environmental factors affect planet formation and evolution
pathways. The classification of host stars in Galactic kinematic terms
constitutes a potentially useful axis for the interpretation of orbital
eccentricity, when included together with stellar metallicity and age.
Leveraging the photoeccentric effect, we constrain orbital eccentricities for
the sample of Kepler planets and candidates orbiting F, G, K and M dwarf stars.
With Gaia astrometry, inferred Galactic phase space information, and kinematic
disk criteria calibrated on stellar chemical abundances, we probabilistically
associate each planet host with the kinematic thin or thick Galactic disks. We
then fit the underlying eccentricity distributions for the single- and
multi-transit populations. We find that for single-transiting planets,
kinematic thick disk planets exhibit higher eccentricities than thin disk
planets, yet we find no such difference among multis. We determine that the
difference in eccentricity is unlikely to be caused solely by the effects of
host stellar metallicity or giant planet occurrence. We situate these findings
in the context of known eccentricity relations, including its relationships
with planet multiplicity, radius and metallicity. We suggest comprehensive
analyses to disentangle these results from the effects of poorly understood
star-planet relationships, such as that between stellar age and planetary
orbital dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超短周期行星为研究强恒星潮汐相互作用下的行星演化提供了宝贵机会，探索其在特定双行星系统中的形成机制有助于理解观测到的系统架构。

Method: 通过数值模拟研究双行星系统，分析外层热木星对内层行星的长期摄动效应，考察质量比、轨道偏心率、潮汐耗散等关键因素对USP形成的影响。

Conclusion: 该机制可以解释观测中最常见的系统架构：要么是热木星带有内层短周期行星，要么是孤独的热木星系统。

Abstract: Ultra-short-period (USP) planets, defined as those with orbital periods
shorter than 1 day, provide valuable insights into planetary evolution under
strong stellar tidal interactions. In this work, we investigate the formation
of USP planets in two-planet systems consisting of an inner terrestrial planet
accompanied by an outer hot Jupiter (HJ). Our simulation results show USP
planets can form through a process driven by secular perturbations from the
outer companion, which induce eccentricity excitation, tidal dissipation, and
subsequent orbital decay of the inner planet. The probability of USP formation
is governed by key factors, including the mass ratio between two planets, their
orbital eccentricities, and the tidal dissipation process. 6.7\% of our
simulations form USP planets, and USP planets form most efficiently when the
mass ratio is around 4 $M_{\oplus}{\rm /}M_{\rm J}$, with the inner planet less
than 8 $M_{\oplus}$. Furthermore, the eccentricity of the outer HJ plays a
crucial role-moderate eccentricities ($e_{\rm outer}<0.1$) favor USP formation,
whereas higher eccentricities ($e_{\rm outer}>0.1$) enhance the likelihood of
orbital instability, often resulting in a lonely HJ. USP planets form more
efficiently when the tidal dissipation function of the inner planet is
comparable to the values estimated for terrestrial planets in the solar system.
Comparison with observed planetary systems reveals that systems with large mass
ratios or nearly circular outer planets tend to produce short-period (SP)
planets instead of USP planets. Our findings offer a potential explanation for
the most commonly observed system architectures, which predominantly feature
either an HJ with an inner SP planet or a lonely HJ.

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will unveil for the first time
the full architecture of planetary systems across Galactic distances through
the discovery of up to 200,000 cool and hot exoplanets using microlensing and
transit detection methods. Roman's huge exoplanet haul, and Galactic reach,
will require new methods to leverage the full exoplanet demographic content of
the combined microlensing and transit samples, given the different sensitivity
bias of the techniques to planet and host properties and Galactic location. We
present a framework for technique-agnostic exoplanet demography (TAED) that can
allow large, multi-technique exoplanet samples to be combined for demographic
studies. Our TAED forward modelling and retrieval framework uses parameterised
model exoplanet demographic distributions to embed planetary systems within a
stellar population synthesis model of the Galaxy, enabling internally
consistent forecasts to be made for all detection methods that are based on
spatio-kinematic system properties. In this paper, as a first test of the TAED
framework, we apply it to simulated transit datasets based on the Kepler Data
Release 25 to assess parameter recovery accuracy and method scalability for a
single large homogeneous dataset. We find that optimisation using differential
evolution provides a computationally scalable framework that gives a good
balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of parameter recovery.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文研究了原行星盘中尘埃颗粒的机械排列机制及其对毫米波偏振观测的影响，发现垂直剪切不稳定性导致的机械排列会产生沿圆盘主轴方向的偏振信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原行星盘演化过程中尘埃颗粒生长、沉降和径向漂移会重新排列圆盘结构，不规则形状的尘埃颗粒通过机械排列会在热辐射中产生偏振信号。本文旨在评估机械排列对毫米波线性偏振观测的影响。

Method: 结合3D辐射流体动力学模拟确定气体和尘埃的密度分布与速度场，使用蒙特卡洛尘埃-气体相互作用模拟计算尘埃在气流中的机械排列，最后通过3D蒙特卡洛偏振辐射传输模拟获得合成偏振观测数据。

Result: 发现对净偏振贡献最大的大颗粒在垂直剪切不稳定性作用下可能发生机械排列，漂移速度平行于旋转轴。假设扁球状尘埃颗粒的短轴平行于漂移速度方向，产生的偏振通常沿圆盘主轴方向。

Conclusion: 如果垂直剪切不稳定性等流体动力学不稳定性主导原行星盘运动学，机械排列是这些系统中尘埃排列的有前景机制，毫米偏振可用于追踪排列的毫米级颗粒方向。

Abstract: During the evolution of protoplanetary disks, dust grains start to grow, form
larger particles, settle to the midplane, and rearrange the disk, mainly by the
inward radial drift. Because of this, dust pebbles with an irregular shape
usually align mechanically and thus cause polarization signatures in their
thermal radiation due to dichroic emission or absorption. The goal of this
paper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain
alignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of
linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation
hydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the
velocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction
simulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and,
finally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain
synthetic polarimetric observations. We find that large grains, which
contribute the most to the net polarization, are potentially mechanically
aligned in the protoplanetary disk under the effect of the vertical shear
instability (VSI). Thereby, the drift velocity is parallel to the rotational
disk axis. Assuming oblate dust grains that are aligned with their short axis
parallel to the direction of the drift velocity, the resulting polarization is
usually along the major axis of the disk. This is in contrast to typical drift
models that propose either a radial or azimuthal drift velocity component. If
hydrodynamical instabilities, such as the VSI, dominate the kinematics in
protoplanetary disks, the mechanical alignment of dust is a promising mechanism
for grain alignment in these systems. In that case, the resulting millimeter
polarization allows us to trace the orientation of aligned millimeter-sized
grains.

TL;DR: 天王星卫星系统可能经历了快速的潮汐迁移，包括Ariel和Umbriel之间2:1轨道共振的穿越和逃逸过程，这可以解释Ariel表面的重塑现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近测量显示天王星的潮汐耗散比之前假设的要高，导致其五颗主要卫星的轨道迁移更快，需要考虑之前被忽略的共振穿越事件，特别是Ariel和Umbriel的2:1共振可能发生在近期。

Method: 研究天王星卫星在快速潮汐迁移背景下的轨道历史，包括Ariel和Umbriel之间2:1平均运动共振的穿越，分析通过进一步与Titania的共振相遇来打破该共振的动力学机制。

Result: 对于小的初始偏心率，卫星总是被捕获到2:1共振中。当Ariel的耗散参数k_{2,2}/Q_2<10^{-3}时，通过3:2:1共振链成功破坏2:1共振的概率超过60%，部分模拟结果与当前系统的轨道特征匹配。

Conclusion: 提出的轨道历史需要特定的耗散参数范围，未来天王星任务的数据将验证或否定这一情景。

Abstract: Recent measurements suggest that Uranus may exhibit a higher tidal
dissipation than previously assumed. This enhanced dissipation leads to a
faster orbital migration of its five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel,
Titania, and Oberon. Consequently, resonant encounters that have always been
discarded in previous works need to be included. In particular, Ariel's fast
migration implies that the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance with
Umbriel is extremely likely and it could have occurred in recent times. Capture
into this strong resonance would have induced significant tidal heating within
Ariel, possibly explaining its resurfacing. Therefore, in this work, we aim to
explore the orbital history of the Uranian moons in a context of fast tidal
migration, including the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance between
Ariel and Umbriel. For small initial eccentricities, we confirm that the moons
are always captured into this resonance. As the system is not currently
involved in any mean motion resonance, we investigated possible dynamical
mechanisms for exiting the 2:1 resonance. We show that the resonance could have
been broken by a further resonant encounter with Titania. We analyzed the
crossing of the 4:2:1 and 3:2:1 resonant chains, and looked for the parameter
space where the probability of escaping the resonance is maximized. Taking a
dissipative parameter of Ariel $k_{2,2}/Q_2<10^{-3}$, the passage through the
3:2:1 resonance succeeds in disrupting the 2:1 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion
resonance in more than $60\%$ of our numerical experiments. A fraction of our
simulations results in final low eccentricities and inclinations, which can
eventually match the current orbital features of the system. As the proposed
orbital history requires specific ranges of the dissipative parameters for the
system, future Uranus mission data will validate (or disprove) this scenario.

### [16] [Turbulence and dust fragility in protoplanetary discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24818)
*Simin Tong,Richard Alexander,Giovanni Rosotti*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析模型和数值模拟发现，只有特定的气体湍流和尘埃脆弱性组合（脆弱尘埃在低湍流盘或韧性尘埃在高湍流盘）能够重现ALMA多波长观测结果，且观测到的尘埃环在1.3和3毫米波长下必须是光学厚的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原行星盘中尘埃从微米级增长到行星尺度涉及多个物理过程，但以往研究通常只改变其中一个参数而固定另一个，无法提供完整图像。本研究旨在同时考虑气体湍流和尘埃脆弱性的组合对观测结果的影响。

Method: 使用分析模型和数值尘埃演化模型DustPy，研究不同气体湍流（粘性α参数）和尘埃脆弱性（破碎速度vfrag）组合，并与多波长ALMA观测数据进行比较。

Result: 发现只有特定组合能够重现观测：脆弱尘埃（vfrag=1-2 m/s）在低湍流盘（α=10^-4）或韧性尘埃（vfrag=6-10 m/s）在高湍流盘（α=10^-3）。这一结果对两种常用不透明度（DSHARP和Ricci）都稳健。

Conclusion: 重现观测需要尘埃环在1.3和3毫米波长下光学厚，SED分析可能低估最大颗粒尺寸。在大半径处形成可探测尘埃环具有挑战性，需要在较小半径处更早形成尘埃环以重现随半径减弱的环亮度。

Abstract: Dust growth from micron- to planet-size in protoplanetary discs involves
multiple physical processes, including dust growth and fragmentation, the
streaming instability, and pebble accretion. Disc turbulence and dust fragility
matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while
fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use
analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the
combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce
multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find only appropriate combinations --
fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with
viscous $\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in
discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-3}$ -- can reproduce observations. Our result
is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless
of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed
dust rings to be optically thick at $\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small
dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED
analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight
the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when
incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust
rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius
observed across ALMA wavelengths.

Result: 发现平滑的尘埃分布，无行星雕刻证据；尘埃主要来自70au外行星带，通过恒星风拖曳向内移动；确认了Epsilon Eri b轨道内存在内盘结构。

Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of the debris disk surrounding the nearby,
solar analog Epsilon Eridani obtained as part of the Archetypal Debris Disk GTO
program. Multi-wavelength images from 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu m$ show a
smooth dust distribution with no evidence of sculpting by massive planets
outside of 5 au. Maps of the color temperature and opacity constrain the dust
properties while radiative transfer modeling of a warm dust component traces
the interaction between the debris disk and Epsilon Eri b ($\sim$3.5 au).
Dynamical and collisional modeling further shows that the disk morphology is
dominated by dust produced in the outer planetesimal belt ($\sim 70 \, au$)
moving inward via stellar wind drag. We confirm the presence of a disk interior
to the Epsilon Eri b orbit first detected from mid-IR interferometry. Drag
dominated inner disk regions have also been observed around Vega and Fomalhaut
hinting at the diversity of asteroid belt analogs.

TL;DR: 电磁感应加热是岩石系外行星地幔的重要内部热源，但其对行星内部特性的依赖性尚不明确。研究发现高温、高铁含量和高熔融分数会降低感应加热效率，在GJ 486b中感应加热超过放射性和潮汐加热，而在HD 3167b和GJ 357b中感应加热可忽略不计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁感应加热作为岩石系外行星地幔的重要内部热源，但其对行星内部特性的依赖性尚未得到充分约束，需要系统研究不同温度和成分条件下感应加热的效应。

Method: 构建超地球地幔的电导率剖面，考虑不同温度和成分，评估固态和部分熔融状态下地幔的感应加热效应。

Result: 高地幔温度、高铁含量和高熔融分数都会因增加地幔电导率和磁屏蔽而抑制整体感应加热效率。在GJ 486b中，感应加热超过放射性和潮汐加热，驱动持续表面火山活动和早期挥发物损耗。

Conclusion: 感应加热是围绕磁活跃恒星运行的近距离超地球热演化和大气演化中的关键因素，其重要性取决于恒星磁场强度和行星内部特性。

Abstract: Electromagnetic induction heating has recently been proposed as an important
internal heat source in the mantles of rocky exoplanets. However, its
dependence on planetary interior properties remains poorly constrained. Here we
construct electrical conductivity profiles for super-Earth mantles considering
different temperatures and compositions, and evaluate induction heating in
super-Earth mantles in both solid and partially molten states. We find that
high mantle temperature, iron content, and melt fraction all suppress the
overall induction heating efficiency due to increased mantle conductivity and
magnetic shielding. In GJ 486b, induction heating likely exceeds both
radiogenic heating and tidal heating, driving persistent surface volcanism and
early volatile depletion, whereas HD 3167b and GJ 357b experience insignificant
induction heating due to weak stellar magnetic fields. Our findings highlight
induction heating as a critical factor in the thermal and atmospheric evolution
of close-in super-Earths around magnetically active stars.

Abstract: When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and
Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C. Sagan & E. E. Salpeter 1976),
the nature of life in Earth's atmosphere remained widely unknown. Decades
later, research has revealed a remarkable variety of microorganisms in our
atmosphere. However, the spectral features of airborne microbes as biomarkers
for detecting atmospheric life remained a mystery. Here, we present the first
reflectance spectra of biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms based on
laboratory cultivars of seven microbial strains isolated from Earth's
atmosphere. We show their distinct UV-resistant biosignatures and their impacts
on models of diverse planetary scenarios, using Habitable Worlds Observatory
(HWO) parameters. The reflectance of these biopigments from aerial bacteria
creates the means to detect them on other Earth-like planets. It provides a
paradigm shift that moves the search for life beyond the surface of a planet to
ecosystems in atmospheres and clouds.
