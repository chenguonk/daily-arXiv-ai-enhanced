Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 在紧密双星系统中发现了19个气态巨行星，这些行星形成于雪线以内不稳定区域，挑战了传统认为气态巨行星必须在雪线外形成的理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理论认为气态巨行星必须在雪线外形成，但在紧密双星系统中，伴星引力使雪线区域不稳定，理论上不应形成气态巨行星，然而观测发现这类系统确实存在且不罕见。

Method: 分析了393个双星系统及其气态巨行星数据，识别出19个雪线区域不稳定的系统，通过潮汐力矩模型解释行星形成机制。

Result: 这些系统的金属丰度和轨道偏心率分布与背景群体一致，排除了捕获或增强固体丰度的成因。潮汐力矩截断原行星盘，形成压力凸起和尘埃陷阱，促进了气态巨行星的形成。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在雪线内形成气态巨行星的可能性，支持了尘埃陷阱在行星形成中的作用，并对理解行星形成过程具有重要启示。

Abstract: Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where
water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth \citep{Pollack1996,
Armitage2024}. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star's
gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable
\citep[]{Holman1999}, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form.
Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393
binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify
19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their
metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population,
making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their
formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be
resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the
protoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that
facilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully
predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties.
Moreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be
evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting
the model and pointing to these being second-generation planets. Our results
have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes
and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the
role of trap-dusts in their formation.

Abstract: Many white dwarfs have accreted material from their own planetary systems.
These objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and
identify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf
atmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the
true composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted
metals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various
physical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on
the effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline
mixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated
atmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete
treatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in
accreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including
thermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems,
the effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the
overall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available
grids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a
large impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the
inferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems
for which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We
also present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential
impact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling.

### [3] [Clouds as the driver of variability and colour changes in brown dwarf atmospheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18090)
*Lucas Teinturier,Benjamin Charnay,Aymeric Spiga,Bruno Bezard*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用三维全球气候模型研究发现，云层在褐矮星大气特性和L/T转变中起主要作用，云辐射效应触发大气对流，导致光谱、空间和时间变化，与观测到的变异性和L/T转变一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 褐矮星是类似巨型系外行星的天体，其L/T转变的驱动机制仍不清楚，通常认为大气环流和/或云层是潜在机制，需要研究云层在褐矮星大气中的作用。

Method: 使用包含云形成、传输和多波长辐射效应的三维全球气候模型，模拟褐矮星的大气特性。

Result: 云辐射效应触发大气对流，导致褐矮星的光谱、空间和时间变化，低纬度地区存在持续的波动活动，而涡旋主导高纬度地区，与观测到的变异性和L/T转变一致。

Conclusion: 云层作为大气动力学和气候驱动因素的作用，从巨型系外行星扩展到所有亚恒星天体。

Abstract: Brown dwarfs are massive, giant exoplanet analogues subject to variability
and colour changes, known as the L/T transition, fundamental for their thermal
evolution. The drivers of the L/T transition remain elusive, with atmospheric
circulations and/or clouds usually suggested as potential mechanisms. Using a
three-dimensional Global Climate Model including cloud formation, transport and
multi-wavelength radiative effects, we show that clouds play a major role in
shaping the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs. Cloud radiative effect,
which triggers atmospheric convection, leads to spectral, spatial, and temporal
variability in the modelled brown dwarfs, in agreement with the observed
variability and L/T transition. Low latitudes are subject to sustained wave
activity, whereas eddies dominate higher latitudes. Our results highlight that
the role of clouds as a driver of atmospheric dynamics and climate, well known
for giant exoplanets, extends to all sub-stellar bodies.

### [4] [The Atmospheric Composition of Sub-Neptune K2-18 b and Implications for its Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18098)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 对K2-18 b的JWST传输光谱进行独立重新分析，评估先前声称的检测可靠性，发现甲烷(CH4)在所有配置中稳健检测(3-4σ)，但二氧化碳(CO2)检测较弱且高度模型依赖，二甲基硫化物(DMS)的初步检测在最全面检索模型中消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估JWST对亚海王星K2-18 b大气观测结果的稳健性，探索参数空间对其形成的影响，特别是先前声称的大气成分检测的可靠性。

Method: 使用公共和定制化管道组合减少观测数据，产生12个不同版本的传输光谱，通过变化光谱分箱、临边昏暗和新的恒星黑子遮挡校正。使用TauREx 3进行大气检索，比较不同复杂度的模型。

Result: 在所有配置中稳健检测到甲烷(3-4σ)，CO2检测较弱且模型依赖，DMS检测消失。恒星黑子校正是关键步骤，影响平均分子量推断。检索模型复杂度本身引入显著偏差。数据与富氢大气一致，具有超太阳C/O比。

Conclusion: K2-18 b的物理特性与"由内向外行星形成"(IOPF)理论预期一致，形成于碳"烟灰"线内部，原始大气继承了原行星盘的高C/O比。

Abstract: Unlocking the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes is among JWST's major achievements,
yet such observations demand complex analyses that strongly affect
interpretations. We present an independent reanalysis of the original JWST
transmission spectrum of K2-18 b, to assess the robustness of previously
claimed detections, explore the parameter space, and implications for its
formation. The observations were reduced using a combination of public and
customized pipelines producing a total of 12 different versions of the
transmission spectrum by varying: spectral binning, limb-darkening, and a novel
correction for the occulted stellar spot. We then performed atmospheric
retrievals using TauREx 3, comparing models of varying complexity, robustly
detecting CH$_4$ (3-4$\sigma$) across all configurations. The evidence for
CO$_2$ is weaker and highly model-dependent. The tentative detection of
dimethyl sulphide (DMS) vanishes in our most comprehensive retrieval models. We
find that correcting the stellar spot in the NIRISS transit is a critical step,
introducing a uniform offset that primarily drives the inference of a lower
mean molecular weight atmosphere. Furthermore, the assumed complexity of the
retrieval model itself introduces significant biases; including more molecules
systematically increases the retrieved CH$_4$ abundance and atmospheric mean
molecular weight, even for species without spectral features. The data are
consistent with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with an elevated O and an even more
elevated C abundance, leading to a super-solar C/O. We show that the physical
properties of the system planets K2-18 c, and K2-18 b are consistent with those
expected by the in situ formation theory of Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF),
interior to the carbon "soot" line, where an elevated C/O ratio of a primordial
atmosphere is expected to be inherited from the protoplanetary disk.

### [5] [A Physical Model for the Ice Coma of 3I/ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18157)
*Eric Keto,Abraham Loeb*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究解释了星际彗星3I/ATLAS在接近太阳过程中反尾消失和常规尾形成的物理机制，主要归因于水冰颗粒散射截面在3-4AU达到峰值，随后被更持久的耐火颗粒主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释哈勃望远镜观测到的星际彗星3I/ATLAS在2025年7月21日出现的明显向阳反尾，以及随后凯克和双子南天文台观测到的反尾减少和常规尾形成的物理演化过程。

Method: 通过建立彗星与日心距离的函数模型，模拟冰彗发中散射的视亮度，分析水冰颗粒散射截面随距离变化的规律。

Result: 研究发现水冰颗粒散射截面在3-4AU处达到峰值，随着彗星更接近太阳，散射被生存时间更长的耐火颗粒和较大挥发性颗粒主导，形成常规彗尾。

Conclusion: 彗星反尾到常规尾的演化是由水冰颗粒散射截面峰值和颗粒生存时间变化共同导致的，其中CO₂升华驱动的水冰颗粒喷射在特定距离范围内主导散射效应。

Abstract: High-resolution imaging of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the Hubble Space
Telescope on July 21, 2025 revealed a pronounced sunward anti-tail with a
projected 2:1 elongation that our earlier study suggests is dominated by
scattering off grains of H$_2$O ice ejected from the nucleus by CO$_2$
sublimation. Subsequent observations with the Keck and Gemini South
observatories showed a reduction in the anti-tail and the growth of a
conventional tail in a direction away from the sun. In this study we explain
the physics behind this evolution. As a function of heliocentric distance, we
model the apparent visual brightness of scattering in the ice coma. As the
comet approaches the Sun, the exponential temperature dependence of the
sublimation rate causes a continuous increase in the production rate of ice
grains and a sharp decline in their residence time within the observing
aperture. The combined effects produce a peak in total scattering cross-section
due to H$_2$O ice grains at 3-4 AU. At closer distances, the scattering becomes
dominated by longer-lived refractory and larger volatile grains with survival
times long enough to form a conventional tail.

### [6] [Acceleration of planetary migration: Resonance crossing and planetesimal ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18382)
*Hailiang Li,Li-Yong Zhou,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过数值模拟研究行星迁移的加速机制，发现行星迁移是正反馈过程，迁移速度越快消耗星子越高效。确认了海王星最终位置与初始星子表面密度相关，并识别了两种迁移加速机制：天王星与海王星的MMR以及星子盘中的环结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行星迁移是早期太阳系形成的关键阶段，能解释许多观测现象并为太阳系起源提供约束。本文旨在通过数值模拟详细研究行星迁移过程中的加速机制，深入探索早期太阳系保存的信息。

Method: 使用数值模拟方法研究行星迁移过程，分析迁移速率与星子消耗效率的关系，探讨海王星位置与星子表面密度的相关性，识别迁移加速的具体机制。

Result: 发现行星迁移是正反馈过程：迁移越快，星子消耗越高效；迁移减慢时海王星会清除周围空间使进一步迁移更困难。迁移速率增加10倍对应海王星单位角动量增加所需消耗的星子质量减少约30%。海王星最终位置与初始星子表面密度相关，30au处盘密度约为0.009M⊕/au²。识别两种加速机制：天王星与海王星的MMR以及星子盘环结构。

Conclusion: 当前太阳系中海王星处于相对微妙的位置。如果海王星曾穿越与天王星的1:2 MMR，可能迁移到更远位置。在正反馈机制影响下，太阳系演化至当前构型可能是随机结果而非必然结果。

Abstract: Planetary migration is a crucial stage in the early solar system, explaining
many observational phenomena and providing constraints on details related to
the solar system's origins. This paper aims to investigate the acceleration
during planetary migration in detail using numerical simulations, delving
deeper into the early solar system's preserved information. We confirm that
planetary migration is a positive feedback process: the faster the migration,
the more efficient the consumption of planetesimals; once the migration slows
down, Neptune clears the surrounding space, making further migration more
difficult to sustain. Quantitatively, a tenfold increase in migration rate
corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in the mass of planetesimals
consumed to increase per unit angular momentum of Neptune. We also find that
Neptune's final position is correlated with the initial surface density of
planetesimals at that location, suggesting that the disk density at 30au was
approximately 0.009$M_{\oplus}/au^2$ in the early solar system. Two mechanisms
that can accelerate planetary migration are identified: the first is MMR
between Uranus and Neptune. Migration acceleration will be triggered whenever
these two giant planets cross their major MMR. The second mechanism is the ring
structure within the planetesimal disk, as the higher planetesimal density in
this region can provide the material support necessary for migration
acceleration. Our research indicates that Neptune in the current solar system
occupies a relatively delicate position. In case Neptune crossed the 1:2 MMR
with Uranus, it could have migrated to a much more distant location. Therefore,
under the influence of the positive feedback mechanism, the evolution of the
solar system to its current configuration might be a stochastic outcome rather
than an inevitable consequence.

### [7] [Locked In Ice: how Pebble Drift and Volatile Entrapment can Significantly Impact Carbon and Oxygen Ratios in Evolving Protoplanetary Discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18587)
*Joe Williams,Sebastiaan Krijt,Bertram Bitsch,Adrien Houge,Jennifer Bergner*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个将卵石生长和漂移与CO在水冰中捕获相结合的模型，发现CO捕获会显著影响碳和氧的分布，增强水雪线内侧的气相C/O和C/H比值，为内盘引入更多碳同时保留大量水。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卵石漂移模型将挥发性物质视为在各自雪线处单独升华，但JWST观测表明冰可能是混合的，实验室研究显示冰混合物可能表现出更复杂的升华行为。

Method: 开发了首个耦合卵石生长、漂移与CO在水冰中捕获的模型，CO被捕获在冰中阻止其在雪线处升华，而是在130K的水结晶前沿通过火山脱附释放。

Result: CO捕获使气相C/O和C/H比值在水雪线内侧增加高达10倍，在CO2雪线附近增加几倍；O/H在CO2雪线附近也增加，但在内盘以水为主；水雪线附近的气相重元素含量可增加高达150%。

Conclusion: CO捕获为内盘引入更多碳同时保留大量水提供了机制，对准确模拟盘成分和行星形成具有重要意义，与JWST观测有密切联系。

Abstract: The complex interplay between the growth, drift, and sublimation of
ice-covered pebbles can strongly influence the volatile distribution and
evolution of disc composition, and therefore impact the composition of forming
planets. Classic pebble drift models treat volatile species individually as
sublimating at their respective snowlines, although observations from the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that ices are likely mixed; laboratory
studies suggest ice mixtures can exhibit more complex sublimation behaviours,
remaining trapped beyond their nominal sublimation temperatures. We present the
first model that couples pebble growth and drift with CO entrapment inside
water ice - preventing a fraction (up to ~60%) of the CO from sublimating at
its snowline, instead desorbing via volcanic desorption at the water
crystallisation front, at 130K. Our models show that CO entrapment will
significantly impact the carbon and oxygen distributions, enhancing the
gas-phase C/O and C/H inside the water snowline by up to a factor of 10 over 1
Myr and a factor of a few around the CO2 snowline; O/H is also increased around
the CO2 snowline, but is water-dominated in the inner disc. Entrapment
therefore provides a means of introducing more carbon to the inner disc whilst
retaining a large amount of water. We discuss connections to planet formation,
noting that CO entrapment can increase the gas-phase heavy element content
around the water snowline by up to 150%. We also consider links to JWST
observations and highlight the importance of entrapment for pebble drift models
to accurately model disc composition.

TL;DR: 利用阿联酋火星任务（EMM）的EMIRS仪器观测数据，分析了火星大气中温度的日变化和热潮汐现象，揭示了不同潮汐成分的季节变化特征及其与尘埃、水冰云的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏观测数据，对火星大气日变化的理解受到限制。EMM任务通过其独特的高轨道提供了完整的地理和当地时间覆盖，使得能够研究火星大气在全行星尺度上的日变化。

Method: 使用EMIRS仪器观测的温度剖面数据，覆盖整个火星年（MY 36 LS=49°至MY 37 LS=49°）。分析日温度变化模式和热潮汐特征，并与更新的火星行星气候模型（PCM v6）进行比较。

Result: 日温度模式显示在大多数季节以日潮为主，而半日潮在近日点附近具有相似振幅。日潮的纬度分布季节变化与纬向风的总涡度相关，半日潮与尘埃和水冰云相关，三日潮仅与尘埃相关。

Conclusion: EMM观测为理解火星大气日变化提供了重要数据，揭示了不同潮汐成分的季节变化机制。与PCM模型的比较表明在模拟尘埃和水循环及其辐射过程方面有所改进。

Abstract: The Martian atmosphere experiences large diurnal variations due to the ~24.6
h planetary rotation and its low heat capacity. Understanding such variations
on a planetary scale is limited due to the lack of observations, which are
greatly addressed with the recent advent of the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM). As
a result of its unique high-altitude orbit, instruments onboard are capable of
obtaining a full geographic and local time coverage of the Martian atmosphere
every 9-10 Martian days, approximately ~5{\deg} in solar longitude (LS). This
enables investigations of the diurnal variation of the current climate on Mars
on a planetary scale without significant local time (LT) gaps or confusions
from correlated seasonal variations. Here, we present the results of diurnal
temperature variations and thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere using
temperature profiles retrieved from the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer
(EMIRS) observations. The data during the primary mission is included, covering
an entire Martian Year (MY) starting from MY 36 LS = 49{\deg}. The diurnal
temperature patterns suggest a dominant diurnal tide in most seasons, while the
semi-diurnal tide presents a similar amplitude near perihelion. The seasonal
variation of the diurnal tide latitudinal distribution is well explained by the
total vorticity due to zonal wind, while that of the semi-diurnal tide
following both dust and water ice clouds, and the ter-diurnal tide following
the dust only. Comparison with the updated Mars Planetary Climate Model (PCM,
version 6) suggest improvements in simulating the dust and water cycles, as
well as their radiative processes.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文采用多模型稀疏采样集成方法研究TRAPPIST-1 e系外行星的大气成分与气候关系，发现CO2和CH4在某些条件下可在<10次凌星观测中被探测到，且寒冷气候更有利于表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术目标是建立多模型稀疏采样集成方法以探索系外行星科学中的大参数空间；科学目标是确定TRAPPIST-1 e不同大气成分下观测与底层气候之间的关系。

Method: 使用1D光化学模型、3D气候模型和透射光谱模型，通过准蒙特卡洛稀疏采样方法分析N2、CO2、CH4和H2O等大气成分，包括水云和光化学雾霾。

Result: 云和雾霾对透射光谱有显著影响，但CO2和CH4在某些组成和气候状态下可在<10次凌星中被探测；寒冷气候因相对干燥和云层较少而更易表征；CH4体积混合比>10^-3会引发强反温室冷却效应。

Conclusion: 稀疏采样方法可用于探索更广泛的参数空间和其他可观测系外行星；在解释盘平均发射和反照率时需谨慎，因为低反照率和高热发射可能与寒冷行星相关。

Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 e is one of a few habitable zone exoplanets that is amenable to
characterization in the near term. In this study our motivations are both
scientific and technical. Our technical goal is to establish a multimodel
sparse sampled ensemble approach for coherently exploring large unconstrained
parameter spaces typical in exoplanet science. Our science goal is to determine
relationships that connect observations to the underlying climate across a
large parameter space of atmospheric compositions for TRAPPIST-1 e. We consider
atmospheric compositions of N2, CO2, CH4, and H2O, with water clouds and
photochemical hazes. We use a 1D photochemical model, a 3D climate model, and a
transmission spectral model, filtered through a quasi-Monte Carlo sparse
sampling approach applied across atmospheric compositions. While clouds and
hazes have significant effects on the transmission spectra, CO2 and CH4 can be
potentially detected in <10 transits for certain compositional and climate
states. Colder climates have better prospects for characterization, due to
being relatively dry and having fewer clouds, permitting transmission
observations to probe more deeply into their atmospheres. CH4 volume mixing
ratios of >$10^{-3}$ trigger strong antigreenhouse cooling, where near-IR
absorption simultaneously creates an inversion in the stratosphere and reduces
the stellar radiation reaching the planet surface. In such cases, interpreting
the disk-averaged emission and albedo at face value can yield misleading
conclusions, as here low albedo and high thermal emission are associated with
cold planets. Future work will use our sparse sampling approach to explore
broader parameter spaces and other observationally amenable exoplanets.

TL;DR: 对星际彗星3I/ATLAS在2025年7-9月进行的观测显示，其尘埃产生率随日心距离呈rH^(-1.8±0.3)变化，符合二氧化碳为主要活动驱动物的预期。彗星形态从太阳方向尘埃扇转变为反太阳方向尘埃尾，主导尘埃颗粒有效半径约0.1毫米，与2I/Borisov相似但活动性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究星际彗星3I/ATLAS的活动特性和尘埃产生机制，了解其与太阳系彗星及另一星际彗星2I/Borisov的异同。

Method: 使用北欧光学望远镜在2025年7-9月进行彗星观测，采用固定孔径测光法分析光度变化与日心距离的关系，研究尘埃颗粒大小和形态变化。

Result: 尘埃产生率随日心距离呈rH^(-1.8±0.3)变化，符合强挥发性物质预期；主导尘埃颗粒有效半径0.1毫米，喷射速度5米/秒；在2au距离处尘埃产生率为180kg/s，比2I/Borisov高约2.6倍。

Conclusion: 3I/ATLAS的尘埃产生机制与太阳系彗星无显著差异，其主导尘埃颗粒大小与2I/Borisov相似但活动性更强，可能反映了星际彗星的共性特征。

Abstract: We describe pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet
3I/ATLAS taken during July - September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope.
Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law
function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index") n =
3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function
0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production
rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected
of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic
observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The
measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system
comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to
describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine).
The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early
2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later
dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size
(effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant
dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation
pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers
sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion
possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more
effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was
reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller
(asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I
are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.

TL;DR: 该研究通过高分辨率光谱观测三个年轻系外行星（HD 63433b、DS TucAb、HIP 67522b），寻找Hα透射信号以探测大气逃逸现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年轻行星（<500Myr）为探测大气质量损失提供了理想机会，因为此时质量损失仍然很强，可以测试相关的物理过程模型。

Method: 使用HARPS-N、Magellan-PFS和CHIRON高分辨率光谱仪观测三个年轻行星的Hα透射信号，并通过测试光球层谱线验证方法。

Result: HD 63433b和DS TucAb未检测到透射信号（3σ限制分别为0.9%和0.3%），HIP 67522b检测到显著的过量吸收（3.44±0.28%），但需要进一步确认。

Conclusion: 年龄小于50Myr的行星更有利于通过Hα观测探测大气逃逸，尽管较老的行星可能在其他诊断中仍显示逃逸现象。

Abstract: Gaps in the exoplanet population, such as the Neptunian Desert, point to the
importance of mass-loss in sculpting the radii of close-in exoplanets. Young
planets ($<$500Myr) offer the opportunity to detect such mass-loss while it is
still strong, and to test models of the underlying physical processes. We
search for evidence of an H$\alpha$ transit in high-resolution spectra of three
young planets, HD 63433b (400 Myr), DS TucAb (45 Myr), and HIP 67522b (17 Myr)
using HARPS-N, Magellan-PFS, and CHIRON respectively. We validate our method by
testing it on several photospheric lines less impacted by stellar variability.
We find no evidence of a transit signal for HD 63433b and DS Tuc A b (3$\sigma$
limits of 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively). For HIP 67522b, we detect significant
excess absorption (3.44$\pm$0.28%) aligned with the transit time, narrow
compared to the stellar line, and blueshifted from the stellar rest frame. In
combination, these suggest the signal is from the planet. However, stellar
variation in the H$\alpha$ line over the course of the observations is
comparable in size to the transit signature and the duration is shorter than
the photometric transit, so this detection requires confirmation. Our findings,
and other recent results in the literature, suggest that planets younger than
50 Myr are more favorable for the detection of atmospheric escape with
H$\alpha$ observations, though older populations might still show escape in
other diagnostics.
