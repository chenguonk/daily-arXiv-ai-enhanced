### [1] [Efficiency of Hydrodynamic Atmospheric Escape in Hot Jupiters and Super Earths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15787)
*Renata Frelikh,Ruth A. Murray-Clay*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发一维模型研究热木星大气中氢和氦的逃逸过程，揭示三层结构：H3+冷却的分子氢层、Lyman-α冷却的中性氢层和绝热冷却的电离风层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解热木星大气逃逸机制，特别是分子辐射冷却对大气流出的影响，为研究系外行星大气演化提供框架。

Method: 使用一维代码模拟热木星大气逃逸，包含恒星光谱加热电离、辐射冷却、热传导、潮汐引力、H-He反应网络和光电子二次电离。

Result: 发现三层大气结构，热传导在距离>0.2 au时影响显著，中性氢在远距离与电离流出解耦，纯H-He小海王星/超级地球流出温度更低。

Conclusion: 分子辐射冷却在决定行星是否能维持大质量大气中起关键作用，为理解大气流出中分子冷却影响提供分析框架。

Abstract: We develop a flexible one-dimensional code to model the escape of hydrogen and helium from a hot Jupiter as a result of photoionization from extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. We include stellar spectrum heating and ionization, radiative cooling by Lyman-$α$ and H$_3^+$, heat conduction, tidal gravity, a H-He reaction network, and account for the secondary ionization of species by photoelectrons. For a fiducial hot Jupiter, we uncover a three-layer structure: an H$_3^+$-cooled layer of molecular hydrogen at the base, enveloped by a Lyman-$α$-cooled layer of neutral hydrogen, which transitions into an ionized wind layer that is cooled by adiabatic expansion. The highest spectral energy photons are deposited in the molecular layer, where, after accounting for energy loss via photoelectrons and ionization, H$_3^+$ is a substantial radiative coolant. We run a grid of models, varying the distance of our fiducial planet from the star. We find that heat conduction at the base starts to have an effect at distances $\gtrsim 0.2$ au, increasing the H$_3^+$ cooling relative to the EUV input flux. At increasing stellocentric distances, the outflow becomes increasingly more neutral. The neutral hydrogen starts to decouple from the ionized outflow, free-streaming out. In pure H-He mini-Neptune/super-Earth simulations, the outflows are significantly cooler, allowing molecules to survive throughout the outflow, pointing toward the likely importance of molecular cooling in determining whether these planets can maintain massive atmospheres. The analysis in this paper provides a framework for understanding the impact of molecular radiative cooling on atmospheric outflows.

Abstract: A significant amount of work has been devoted to the study of small binary solar system objects. The majority of these binaries, especially among the near-earth or main belt asteroids have small radius ratios, implying a large difference in size between the primary and its companion. Farther from the sun, the binary fraction increases, with the Kuiper Belt having many known binaries with radius ratios of order unity. In this paper, we consider the runaway growth of a binary system in an accretionary stream of small particles. We perform brute-force integrations, each with 10 million test particles and numerically compute the gravitational cross sections for each member of the binary as a function of the system's separation and mass ratio. We show that the behavior of the cross section is complex, and it can be either diminished or enhanced depending on the orbital configuration. In the regime where gravitational focusing dominates the accretion process, we show that binaries grow towards smaller mass ratios than would be expected given single-body cross sections. Finally, we provide a grid of these cross sections for use in the future study of such systems.

### [3] [Methane on the temperate exo-Saturn TOI-199b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15835)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: JWST观测发现温带气态巨行星TOI-199 b大气中存在甲烷，金属丰度约为太阳的13倍，但未检测到CO和CO₂。光谱在3μm处显示异常，可能由NH₃或HCN引起。该行星系统存在明显的凌星时间变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温带气态巨行星（平衡温度<400K）是系外行星大气光谱学中尚未探索的领域，TOI-199 b是研究这类行星大气的最有利目标之一。

Method: 使用JWST的NIRSpec G395M模式对TOI-199 b进行单次凌星观测，获取其透射光谱，并采用贝叶斯反演方法分析大气成分。

Result: 检测到甲烷存在（贝叶斯因子约700），金属丰度C/H=13^{+78}_{-12}×太阳值；未检测到CO和CO₂；光谱在3μm处显示异常特征；系统存在明显的凌星时间变化。

Conclusion: TOI-199 b是研究温带气态巨行星云层和雾霾的第一个数据点，甲烷的检测支持了温带低分子量大气在透射光谱中显示特征的趋势。

Abstract: Temperate ($T_{\rm eq}<400$ K) gas giants represent an unexplored frontier in exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy. Orbiting a G-type star every ~100 days, the Saturn-mass exoplanet TOI-199 b ($T_{\rm eq}=350$ K) is one of the most favorable low-temperature gas giants for atmospheric study. Here, we present its transmission spectrum from a single transit observed with JWST's NIRSpec G395M mode. Despite lower-than-nominal precision due to a pointing misalignment, Bayesian retrievals reveal the presence of CH$_4$ (Bayes factor of $\sim$700 in a cloudy atmosphere), corresponding to a metallicity of $\rm{C/H}=13^{+78}_{-12}\times$ solar, although the absence of detectable CO and CO$_2$ disfavors metallicities $\gtrsim50\times$ solar. We also tested several haze prescriptions (Titan-like tholin, soot, and water-rich tholin), but the preference for these models is weak (Bayes factors of $\sim 2$ relative to the clear case). The spectrum also shows an increase in transit depth near 3 $μ$m, which our self-consistent models attribute to either NH$_3$ or, less likely, HCN. Follow-up observations will distinguish between these species, helping determine the planet's vertical mixing regime. The TOI-199 system exhibits strong transit timing variations (TTVs) due to an outer non-transiting giant planet. For planet c, our TTV analysis reduces its mass uncertainty by 50% and prefers a slightly longer orbital period (still within the conservative habitable zone) and higher eccentricity relative to previous studies. TOI-199 b serves as the first data point for studying clouds and hazes in temperate gas giants. The detection of methane supports the emerging trend that temperate low-molecular-weight atmospheres display spectral features in transmission.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 短周期亚海王星的大气从原生大气向次生大气转变的过程，主要通过大气逃逸和内部脱气机制，导致氦元素耗尽和水元素富集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解短周期亚海王星大气从原生大气向次生大气转变的过程及其对大气成分的影响，特别是解释观测中较小系外行星氦元素未检测到的现象。

Method: 使用一维结构模型模拟行星演化，考虑恒星X射线和极紫外辐射驱动的大气逃逸，以及岩石内部氢、氦和水的脱气过程。

Result: 低质量、近距离行星经历广泛大气逃逸后发生大气转变，大气中氦元素耗尽而水元素富集。行星半径与氦逃逸率之间存在相关性。

Conclusion: 从原生大气向次生大气的转变可以解释相对较小（≲2.5地球半径）系外行星中氦元素未检测到的观测现象。

Abstract: Short-period sub-Neptunes are common in extrasolar systems. These sub-Neptunes are generally thought to have primary atmospheres of protoplanetary-disk gas origin. However, atmospheric escape followed by degassing from their interiors can lead to the transition to secondary atmospheres depleted in gases less-soluble to magma, such as helium. These primary and secondary atmospheres can potentially be distinguished from observations of escaping hydrogen and helium. This study aims to elucidate the impact of the primary-secondary transition on atmospheric compositions of short-period sub-Neptunes. We simulate their evolution with atmospheric escape driven by stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet irradiation and degassing of hydrogen, helium, and water from their rocky interiors, with a one-dimensional structure model. We show that the transition takes place for low-mass, close-in planets which experience extensive atmospheric escape. These planets show the depletion of helium and enrichment of water in their atmospheres, because of their low and high abundances in the planetary interiors, respectively. A compilation of our parameter survey (the orbital period, planetary mass, envelope mass, and mantle FeO content) shows a correlation between the planet radius and the helium escape rate. We suggest that the transition from primary to secondary atmospheres may serve an explanation for helium non-detection for relatively-small ($\lesssim 2.5\ R_\oplus$) exoplanets.

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析小天体（星子）在行星引力散射下轨道能量随机游走的解析框架，将三维轨道演化简化为相对速度向量的二维旋转问题，并推导出Fokker-Planck方程的闭式解。


<details>

Conclusion: 该解析解构成了适用于太阳系和系外行星系统的普适定律，为研究星子和行星的轨道分布与抛射提供了计算高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we introduce a patched-conic framework to describe the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle's orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\mathbf{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet's orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).

Abstract: Spectroscopic characterization of rocky exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope has brought the origin and evolution of their atmospheres into the focus of exoplanet science. Time-evolved models of the feedback between interior and atmosphere are critical to predict and interpret these observations and link them to the Solar System terrestrial planets. However, models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to significant differences in interpretation. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) project. CHILI is an (exo-)planet model intercomparison project within the Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES) framework, which aims to support a diverse set of multi-model intercomparison projects in the exoplanet community. The present protocol includes the initial set of participating magma ocean models, divided into evolutionary and static models, and two types of test categories, one focused on Solar System planets (Earth & Venus) and the other on exoplanets orbiting low-mass M-dwarfs. Both test categories aim to quantify the evolution of key markers of the links between planetary atmospheres and interiors over geological timescales. The proposed tests would allow us to quantify and compare the differences between coupled atmosphere-interior models used by the exoplanet and planetary science communities. Results from the proposed tests will be published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an example, we present initial test results for the early Earth and TRAPPIST-1 b, conducted with models differing in the treatment of energy transport in the planetary interior and atmosphere, surface boundary layer, geochemistry, and the in- and outgassing of volatile compounds.

### [7] [Asteroid phase curve modeling with empirical correction for shape and viewing geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16237)
*Dagmara Oszkiewicz. Przemysław Bartczak,Milagros Colazo,Antti Penttilä*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预计算自转形状模型的小行星相位曲线校正方法，通过将稀疏光度数据归一化到极向几何，实现跨观测期的相位曲线拟合，并建立了新的物理约束条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要解决小行星相位曲线中旋转和几何效应的影响，实现跨不同观测期的相位曲线一致拟合，并确保拟合参数的物理意义。

Method: 使用预计算的自转形状模型将稀疏光度数据归一化到极向几何，拟合H,G1,G2和H,G12相位函数，数值推导物理约束条件，比较基于导数和无导数优化方法。

Result: 应用于ATLAS巡天观测的25,000多颗小行星，验证了方法的实用性，建立了更宽松的物理约束条件，并提供了HG12函数收敛问题的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 新方法能够基于统计模型选择标准和物理约束条件选择最优的自转形状解，为小行星相位曲线分析提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: We present a novel empirical method for correcting asteroid phase curves for rotational and geometrical effects using precomputed spin-and-shape models. Our approach normalizes sparse photometric data to a pole-on geometry, enabling consistent phase-curve fitting across apparitions. We fit both the H,G1,G2 and H,G12 phase functions to the normalized data. We also numerically derive new constraints on parameter ranges that ensure physically meaningful solutions. These constraints are based on the requirement that the reduced magnitude must monotonically decrease with phase angle and remain within plausible slope bounds. Compared to earlier bounds, our new constraints are more permissive. We also compare derivative-based and derivative-free optimization methods, highlighting convergence issues with the HG12 function and offering mitigation strategies. We applied our method to over 25,000 asteroids observed by the ATLAS survey, demonstrating its usability. The new method enables the selection of the preferred spin-and-shape solution based on either statistical phase-curve model selection criteria and/or physically motivated constraints on the phase-curve shape.

### [8] [Dynamical simulation of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16247)
*Goldy Ahuja,Shashikiran Ganesh*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 对3I/ATLAS彗星（C/2025 N1）进行动力学模拟研究，分析其与火星和木星的相互作用，以及非引力力对轨道参数的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3I/ATLAS是迄今发现的三个星际天体中速度最快的（v∞ ∼ 58 km/s），研究其与行星的相互作用有助于理解星际天体的动力学演化。

Method: 使用REBOUND N体模拟软件包，采用IAS15自适应积分器，长期积分步长为1天，近距离遭遇时步长为1小时，进行过去和未来100年的轨道演化模拟。

Result: 木星对彗星轨道参数有显著影响，显著改变其过近日点后的轨迹；火星的影响相对较小，这与彗星分别接近木星和火星希尔半径的距离一致。

Conclusion: 非引力力将改变模拟结果，由于目前未知其具体大小，作者预测了不同非引力加速度量级下轨道参数的可能变化范围。

Abstract: Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT by NASA Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), with a v$_{\infty}$ $\sim$ 58 kms$^{-1}$. This is the fastest among the three interstellar objects discovered so far. In this work, we study the interaction of the 3I/ATLAS with Mars, pre-perihelion, and Jupiter post-perihelion. We also present the results of the dynamical simulations of the orbital evolution of the comet for a hundred years in the past and future. For our analysis, we have used REBOUND, an N-Body simulation package, to study these situations. We use the adaptive size mathematical integrator \textsc{Ias15}, with a 1-day time step for long-term integration, and a 1-hour time step to study the effect of the planets on this body during the close encounters. We have seen an effect of Jupiter on the orbital parameters of the comet, which affects its post-perijove trajectory significantly. The impact of Mars on this comet is minimal compared to the effect of Jupiter. This is consistent with the point that the comet moves well past Mars's Hill radius but very close to Jupiter's Hill radius at the respective close approaches. However, the effect of non-gravitational forces will alter the results. Since the non-gravitational forces are not yet known, we predict the variation of the orbital parameters considering a range of possible magnitudes of the non-gravitational acceleration.

### [9] [An observationally based wind model contemporaneous with the radio detections in $τ$ Boötis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16370)
*Dag Evensberget,Aline A. Vidotto,Filip Elekes,Sandra V. Jeffers,Rik T. Luisman*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 基于LOFAR射电信号探测，研究τ Boötis Ab系外行星与宿主恒星磁场和星风的相互作用，通过三维星风建模预测射电通量密度，发现预测值远低于观测值，需要更强的恒星磁场才能解释观测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释LOFAR探测到的来自τ Boötis系统的射电信号，这些信号被谨慎归因于热木星τ Boötis Ab的极光发射，而极光发射被认为是由系外行星与宿主恒星风相互作用激发的。

Method: 通过同时期的光谱偏振观测推导τ Boötis A的大尺度磁场图，创建三维数值星风模型，应用两种方法计算行星磁层中耗散的星风功率：A)基于太阳系的经验关系（波德定律）；B)行星磁层的解析数值模型。

Result: 预测的射电通量密度分别为约50 mJy和0.68 mJy，远低于报告的观测值890_{-500}^{+690} mJy，需要恒星表面磁场缩放≥10倍才能重现观测信号强度。

Conclusion: 同时期恒星磁场观测和星-行星相互作用观测特征的重要性，推测由恒星磁性变化引起的星风变化可能解释后续观测缺乏探测的原因。

Abstract: Recent low-frequency array (LOFAR) radio signal detections bearing from the $τ$ Boötis system have been cautiously attributed to auroral emissions from the hot Jupiter $τ$ Boötis Ab. The auroral emissions are believed to be excited by interaction between the exoplanet and the winds of its host star. Since stellar winds respond to stellar surface magnetism, three-dimensional stellar wind modelling, able to account for the star's contemporaneous magnetic field geometry, can aid the interpretation of radio detections. For the first time, we present spectropolarimetric observations of $τ$ Boötis A from the same epoch as the LOFAR detections. We derive a contemporaneous large-scale magnetic map of $τ$ Boötis A, which shows a poloidally dominated field with mean strength 1.6 G. From our magnetic map, we create a three-dimensional numerical wind model and characterise the wind properties around $τ$ Boötis Ab. To compute the wind power dissipated in $τ$ Boötis Ab's magnetosphere, we apply two approaches: A) the solar system-based empirical relation called Bode's law; and B) a resolved numerical model of the planetary magnetosphere. When consistently applying best-case assumptions, we redict radio flux densities around 50 mJy and 0.68 mJy respectively. Our values are much too small to be consistent with the reported observation of $890_{-500}^{+690}$ mJy; a stellar surface magnetic field scaling $\gtrsim 10$ is required to reproduce the observed signal strength. As $τ$ Boötis A has a rapid magnetic cycle, we speculate that wind variations cased by variation in stellar magnetism may explain the lack of detections from follow-up observations. Our work emphasises the importance of contemporaneous observations of stellar magnetism and observational signatures of star-planet interaction.

Motivation: 测量原行星盘中尘埃颗粒的大小，直接约束尘埃生长过程，理解不同年龄星形成区域中尘埃演化的时间序列。

Result: 上蝎座区域原行星盘的平均毫米波谱指数为2.09±0.10，与金牛座、蛇夫座、狼疮座等更年轻区域相当或略小，表明尘埃颗粒显著大于星际介质中的颗粒。

Conclusion: 观测结果支持盘内半径增加的演化模型，表明即使在演化晚期，外盘区域（尘埃温度低于20K）仍存在大量尘埃质量，为理解尘埃生长和原行星盘时间演化提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The measurement of dust size from millimeter-wavelength spectra provides direct constraints on grain growth in protoplanetary disks. The spectral indices between 0.88 mm and 2.9 mm have been measured in multiple young star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Ophiuchus, and Lupus, which have ages of 1-3 Myr. These spectral indices are as low as 2-3, suggesting that grains in disks are much larger than those in the interstellar medium. In this study, we analyze the ALMA archival data of 23 disks in the Upper Scorpius region. The observed wavelength is 2.9 mm in Band 3, the angular resolution is 3.3 arcsec x 2.1 arcsec, which is not high enough to resolve the targets, and the rms noise is below 0.075 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for almost all sources. Together with the literature values of the Band 7 fluxes of the same targets, we find that the average spectral index of the disks in the Upper Scorpius region is $α_\mathrm{mm}=2.09 \pm 0.10$, which is equal to or slightly smaller than those at the other younger regions. To explain the relationship between the fluxes and spectral indices of the disks in the Taurus, Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius regions, we construct simple disk evolution models. The observations are best reproduced by models in which the inner radius of the disk increases. This suggests that a substantial amount of dust mass must persist in the outer disk regions where the dust temperature is lower than 20 K even at late evolutionary stages. These findings offer key insights into the grain growth and the temporal evolution of protoplanetary disks.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用盖亚DR3可见光反射光谱研究主带中外部C型和X型小行星家族的光谱特征，发现8个家族可能更适合分类为T/D型而非原先的C/X型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 暗色小行星具有中性到红色的特征光谱，可能含有原始、含水甚至富含有机物的物质，对理解太阳系早期物质组成有重要意义。

Method: 利用盖亚数据发布3（Gaia DR3）的可见光反射光谱，分析主带中外部（轨道半长轴2.5-3.7天文单位）C型和X型小行星家族的平均光谱剖面。

Result: 发现8个先前分类为C型和X型的小行星家族具有比其分类所暗示的更红斜率，可能更适合归类为T/D型家族，这些家族可能为近地小行星提供T/D型来源。

Conclusion: 这些家族可能确实是T/D型，但需要进一步的红外观测来验证这一识别。

Abstract: Dark asteroids with featureless neutral to red spectra are of particular interest due to their ability to potentially harbour primitive, hydrated, and possibly organic-rich material. These asteroids belong to the spectroscopic C-complex, to the X-types with low geometric visible albedo values as well as to the T- and D-type end members of the Bus-DeMeo spectroscopic taxonomy. Here we used Gaia Data Release 3 visible reflectance spectra to study the average spectral profiles of the C- and X-complex asteroid families in the central and outer main belt (orbital semi-major axis between 2.5 - 3.7~au). We found that eight of these families, namely 96 Aegle, 627 Charis, 1484 Postrema and 5438 Lorre, previously classified as C-complex families, and 322 Phaeo, 1303 Luthera, 5567 Durisen and 53546 2000BY6 previously classified as X-complex families, have redder slopes than implied by their previous classification and could be better classified as T-/D-type families. Some of these families may also feed the near-Earth asteroid population, being responsible for the observed T-/D-type excess. However, the analysis of their principal components of Gaia Data Release 3 spectra suggest that further near-infrared observations are needed in order to verify this identification.

Abstract: Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are a powerful tool for detecting unseen companions in systems with known transiting exoplanets and for characterizing their masses and orbital properties. Large-scale and homogeneous TTV analyses are a valuable method to complement the demographics of planetary systems and understand the role of dynamical interactions. We present the results of a systematic TTV analysis of 423 systems covering 16000 transits, each with a single transiting planet first discovered by the TESS mission and afterwards confirmed or validated. The primary aim of this survey is to identify the most promising candidates for dynamically active systems that warrant further investigation. In the first stage of our analysis, precise measurements of the transit times are extracted for each system in an homogeneous way. In the second stage, we apply a decision framework to classify candidates by analyzing the resulting variations. Based on excess timing scatter and the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion of periodic models over linear ones, the TTVs are classified as significant, marginal, or non-detections. We find 11 systems with significant TTVs, 5 of which were announced in previous works, and 10 more systems with marginal evidence in our sample. We present 3-panel diagnostic plots for all the candidates, showing phase-folded light curves, the transit variations over time, and the variations folded on the recovered TTV period. A comprehensive summary table detailing the fitted parameters and TTV significance for the entire survey is also provided. This survey constitutes the largest homogeneous TTV analysis of TESS systems to date. We provide the community with updated ephemerides and a catalogue of high-quality TTV candidates, enabling targeted follow-up observations and dynamical modelling to uncover the nature of unseen companions and study system architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出在年轻恒星双星系统中的盘碎裂可能是木星质量自由漂浮行星(JFFPs)的丰富来源。通过3D模拟显示，盘碎裂形成的气态巨行星与次级恒星种子之间的混沌迁移和引力弹弓效应导致行星频繁被抛射。

Motivation: 过去25年的观测发现了大量自由漂浮行星(FFPs)，但其起源仍存在争议。大质量FFPs可能通过分子云引力坍缩形成，而较低质量的FFPs可能来自行星系统后被动力学相互作用抛射。研究旨在探索盘碎裂在年轻双星系统中作为JFFPs来源的可能性。

Method: 使用3D模拟研究具有自引力的巨大盘，其中嵌入木星质量行星和次级恒星种子(5-50木星质量)。分析行星与次级恒星之间的混沌迁移和引力弹弓相互作用。

Result: 行星抛射比例随次级-主星质量比(q_s)急剧增加，当q_s > 0.05时达到0.6。盘碎裂形成的JFFPs比核吸积形成的JFFPs形成更早、抛射速度更低，并可能保留紧凑的环行星盘。

Conclusion: 盘碎裂可能是木星质量自由漂浮行星的重要来源。为解释观测到的JFFPs丰度，这些行星必须处于后坍缩构型，且在双星系统中形成频率更高或在内部盘区域频繁被破坏。

Abstract: Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s > 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory.
