Code available at: https://github.com/jlramirezcolon/hlg-life-detection. AGPLv3 License", "summary": "Amino acids (AAs) are a key target in the search for life beyond Earth due to their extensive role in the machinery of all known life, persistence over geologic timescales, and analytical detectability. However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves >95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems."}

This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances."}

Using the JPL mar099 ephemeris (Brozovic et al. 2025) and SPICE toolkit, I searched the millennium 1600-2600 CE for epochs at which both Martian moons project onto the solar disc at the same instant for at least one surface location. I identify 8565 grazing double transits, 49 partial-overlap double transits (both moons simultaneously on the solar disc, with at least one partially cut off by the limb), and 17 full double transits in which both moons lie wholly within the solar disc at the same moment. All events cluster tightly around the Martian equinoxes (Ls ~ 0 deg or 180 deg) and within +/- 9 deg of the equator, reflecting the near-equatorial orbital inclinations of both moons. I derive a hard theoretical latitude limit of +/- 13.1 deg beyond which simultaneous double transits are geometrically impossible. The next observable partial double transit, excluding less prominent grazing events, is predicted for 2034 April 17. The next full double transit, with both moons wholly inside the solar disc, with a gap between each silhouette and the solar limb, occurs on 2118 November 20. The geometries for both these events were confirmed with JPL Horizons. I provide uncertainty estimates based on the Brozovic et al. covariance model, with predicted position errors growing from ~1 km for near-term events to ~600 km at the catalogue boundaries, and note that the JAXA MMX mission (~2031) will dramatically reduce uncertainties for all post-2030 predictions."}

We report Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of two Neptunes, TOI-181 b and TOI-883 b, obtained with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/PFS and WIYN/NEID. TOI-181 b is on a 4.5-day orbit with a sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment $λ= 32.0_{-6.5}^{+6.3}\\,^{\\circ}$ and a low eccentricity ($e<0.12$ with $2σ$ confidence). TOI-883 b has a longer orbital period of 10 days with $λ= 22_{-14}^{+15}\\,^{\\circ}$ and eccentricity $e = 0.16 \\pm 0.03$. The significant misalignment of TOI-181 b and the significant eccentricity of TOI-883 b are suggestive of high-eccentricity migration for both systems. After adding these and other new measurements to the sample, we analyze the obliquity distribution of the host stars of transiting Neptunes. Earlier studies had suggested that the obliquity distribution is bimodal, with peaks corresponding to aligned orbits and polar orbits; the addition of more measurements has weakened the evidence for bimodality. The current sample appears to be consistent with a population of well-aligned systems and a smaller population with nearly random obliquities. This distribution resembles that observed for more massive planets, suggesting that transiting Jupiters and Neptunes originate from similar dynamical processes."}

Observational strategy and first results", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 14 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "The rotational properties of small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) provide crucial insights into their internal structure and collisional history. However, systematic surveys targeting metre- to decametre-sized bodies are rare, thus leaving their spin distribution poorly constrained. Our aim was to quantify the prevalence of fast rotation and characterise the spin-rate distribution of small NEAs to constrain their internal strength and evolution. We conducted a dedicated high-cadence photometric survey of 249 NEAs using the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT). Rotation periods and amplitudes were derived from dense time series to classify objects as fast or non-fast rotators. We determined the rotation period of 156 new fast rotators (P < 2.2 h), including 87 that rotate faster than 10 min. The prevalence of fast rotators increases with absolute magnitude: from 60.6-80.3 % for 22 < H < 24 to 77.3-89.4 % for 24 < H < 26 and 94.1-96.1 % for H > 26, indicating that fast rotation dominates in the small NEA population. Most objects spin faster than the gravity-defined limit; 98 targets require cohesive strengths exceeding that of weak rubble piles, and 22 are compatible only with compact, high-strength interiors. This is the first systematic survey targeting the rotation of such small NEAs, providing the largest homogeneous sample of fast rotators obtained by a single campaign. Our findings demonstrate that fast rotation is the norm for objects smaller than tens of metres, implying that modest cohesive strength is required to prevent their rotational disruption."}

Article accepted for publication in Annales Geophysicae", "summary": "We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an ``overcooling'' with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models."}

Its widespread presence poleward of 60° latitude was detected by remote neutron spectroscopy and confirmed by the Phoenix lander at 68°N. Recent observations of exposed ice indicate that the near-surface ice layer extends to 35° latitude and exhibits pronounced spatial structure. However, previous models did not capture the observed spatial structure of the midlatitude ice layer. Here, on the basis of improved calculations using the Mars Planetary Climate Model, we show that mid-latitude buried ice could be the remnant of a ice layer deposited on the surface when the obliquity was higher than today. Assuming that the ice subsequently sublimated and became buried beneath a sublimation lag, we estimate that surface ice emplaced 630 kyr (4.18 Myr) ago at 35° obliquity (40°), at latitudes of 40-55°N, would today reside at depths of 25-150 (41-255) cm, depending on the regolith and ice properties. For ice emplaced 630 kyr ago, the modeled burial depths align with observations and capture the observed longitudinal depth variations, in contrast to ice emplaced 4.18 Myr ago. We therefore infer that the mid-latitude subsurface ice is younger than 4 Myr."}

These features can produce pronounced spectral variability. Time-variability monitoring provides a unique window into surface inhomogeneities that cannot be directly resolved with foreseeable imaging technology. Current time-series analysis techniques have provided qualitative constraints on variability mechanisms but lack the ability to quantitatively estimate the extent of variation on atmospheric properties. We present Tempawral, the first data-driven time-resolved atmospheric retrieval framework that quantitatively retrieving variability in atmospheric parameters via an eigen-spectra inversion technique, leveraging the full spectra dataset. We validate this method on simulated time-series spectra of a variable brown dwarf, demonstrating that it successfully recovers key variability drivers, including inhomogeneous cloud coverage, evolving chemical abundances, and changes in temperature structure. We further showcase the utility of Tempawral by applying it to JWST/NIRISS-SOSS time-series observations of a highly variable T2.5 brown dwarf. The observed variability is best explained by a $\\sim$300 K temperature perturbation near the 1-bar, accompanied by variations in the abundances of $\\rm H_{2}O$, $\\rm CO$, $\\rm FeH$, as well as changes in the thickness of the iron cloud deck. This work provides a generalized framework for time-resolved atmospheric retrievals in the JWST era, enabling comprehensive interpretations of dynamic atmospheric processes in substellar objects."}

In this work, we present the first detailed investigation of Justitia's surface dynamics using the newly developed 3-D polyhedral shape model with 574 vertices and 1,144 faces. We analyze its geopotential, surface acceleration, escape speeds, slopes, and equilibrium points, and we also search for planar symmetric periodic orbits using an equivalent ellipsoidal approximation. Our results indicate that the lowest geopotential values occur at the poles, which also correspond to regions of maximum surface acceleration. The global slope distribution suggests preferred zones of material accumulation or migration, offering clues to Justitia's long-term morphological evolution. Most slopes remain below $40^\\circ$, implying that loose particles may settle stably across large portions of the surface. We identify five equilibrium points consistent with Justitia's estimated density and slow rotational period. Two external points (E$_2$ and E$_4$) exhibit linear stability, and all equilibrium locations lie relatively far from the surface due to the body's slow spin. Additionally, we discover 28 new families of planar symmetric periodic orbits, then classify their topologies and determine their linear stability, providing a dynamical framework relevant to future spacecraft operations near Justitia. Finally, thermal modeling reveals how thermal inertia and heliocentric distance shape Justitia's temperature distribution. The south pole receives more insolation than the north pole, reaching minimum temperatures of about 102~K and 87~K, respectively. These combined dynamical and thermal results offer valuable insights for the EMA mission and for understanding slowly rotating small bodies."}

These asteroids form orbital groups, (i.e., asteroid families formed by collisions) and also spectral groups (taxonomies) with different chemical compositions, in particular carbonaceous (C-types) and silicate (S-types). In this paper, we extend the existing main-belt collisional model by finding the appropriate strength-versus-size dependence (also known as the scaling law) for these two groups. We used color indices and geometric albedos of 56 and 72 spectroscopically confirmed C- and S-types (control samples), along with statistical methods on 1 065 034 asteroids, to assign C-, S-, or other types. This allowed us to construct observed size-frequency distributions (SFDs) for several subpopulations constrained by either semimajor axis (inner, middle, outer) or taxonomy (C, S, other). Then we used a Monte Carlo collisional model to compute the long-term collisional evolution (4.5 billion years) and derive synthetic SFDs. Our best-fit scaling laws indicate that S-types must be weaker below approximately 0.2 km than C-types to explain the deficiency of asteroids in the inner part of the main belt near (and below) the observational limit. This may correspond to differences in chemical composition or material porosity. Future research will focus on the scaling laws of asteroids with rare or \"extreme\" taxonomies (e.g., V, M)."}

This radiation-driven structure is an unusual environment for observations of planet formation and differs greatly from the low-mass star-forming regions disks are most commonly observed in. Aided by a collection of visual and spectroscopic data available for this system, this paper aims to infer the possibility of embedded planets existing within the disk and how the system's environment may affect its disk morphology. Using data from the VLT's instruments XSHOOTER, ESPRESSO and - most prominently - SPHERE along with data from ALMA, we make a variety of measurements (geometric, photometric and otherwise) to characterise the observed disk features and attributes such as spiral arms and eccentricity. Mapping of the velocity components is also undertaken using the ALMA gas line data to characterise disk orientation and determine the likelihood that the system is experiencing a late-stage infall event. The disk is found to be eccentric when deprojected. Under the assumption that the formation of a planet is wholly responsible for the primary and secondary spiral arms, we find the mass of such a planet can range between 0.004 and 3 Jupiter masses. Measurement of the velocities associated with nearby globule cloud material returns reasonable velocities for a late-stage infall event. We estimate far-ultraviolet field strength at AT Pyx's location to be low in comparison to other surveyed disks. We also find that AT Pyx is possibly a binary system. AT Pyx is the first disk within a cometary globule to be spatially resolved, and is now the first such disk to be investigated to this extent. The work of this paper could potentially be a first step into the further study of disks in the moderate-FUV environment of the Gum Nebula and its globules."}

We find that the width of the B95 ring remains constant across wavelengths, suggesting that fragmentation dominates over radial diffusion or that unresolved substructure is present within the ring. Resolved spectral modeling yields two families of dust solutions that reproduce the observations equally well: compact grains or highly porous (90\\%) grains, with carbonaceous components dominated by refractory organics or amorphous carbon, respectively.

Using the ACAM instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT), we obtain a transmission spectrum with sub-scale height precision of 246 ppm, with a wavelength range of 495 -- 874 nm and a 20 nm resolution, despite a relatively faint host star ($V\\mathrm{_{mag} = 13.2}$). We detect absorption due to sodium with 3.9$σ$ confidence. Atmospheric retrieval of the transmission spectrum also reveals evidence for \\ch{H2O} absorption and Rayleigh scattering from \\ch{H2} gas consistent with a cool 800 K atmosphere and a super-solar metallicity of 7$\\substack{+16 \\\\ -5}$$\\times$solar. Comparison of retrieval models disfavour the inclusion of a super-Rayleigh scattering slope or high-altitude clouds (at $<1$ mbar) while being agnostic towards the presence of mid-altitude clouds. Our transmission spectrum of HAT-P-44b shows strong similarity to that of its sibling WASP-39b.} This is the tenth planet in the LRG-BEASTS (Low-Resolution Ground-Based Exoplanet Atmosphere Survey using Transmission Spectroscopy) survey."}

Using the ``photoeccentric effect'' in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we first model the population using discrete planetary size bins (sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, and Jovians). We then develop a continuous mixture model with weights governed by a logistic sigmoid function of radius. We find that the warm-single population is best described by two components: a dominant low-eccentricity mode ( <e_low> = 0.070-0.068+0.026) and a secondary dynamically excited mode (<e_high> = 0.616-0.075+0.091). The fraction of planets belonging to this high-eccentricity component increases strongly with planet radius, characterized by a transition at a break radius of R_br = 9.8-1.1+1.4 R_e. This trend places warm sub-Saturns predominantly on the same low-eccentricity track as sub-Neptunes. In contrast, warm Jovians (8--16 R_e) are frequently eccentric, with 59+-13% of the population in the high eccentricity mode. We detect this bimodality at >4sigma, providing statistically significant evidence that warm gas giants are sculpted by two distinct pathways, or a single mechanism with subsequent eccentricity excitation. Finally, we identify a non-negligible tail of highly eccentric sub-Neptunes (1--4 R_e), which comprise 14.9-6.5+5.1% of the population, consistent with excitation by non-transiting external companions."}

In the tidally locked limit, the nightside's tendency to radiatively cool and potentially trap volatiles as permanent ice introduces a strong dependence of habitability on the planet's surface and atmospheric boundary conditions. We perform a suite of synchronously rotating experiments spanning a wide range of topographic and orographic realizations with different mean elevations and landmass distributions. Across a grid of $p_{\\mathrm{N2}} = 0.5$-$8~\\mathrm{bar}$ and $F_{\\star} = 1200$-$1700~\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, we find that surface relief breaks the flow symmetry, replacing the circumpolar vortices with mechanically forced stationary waves. Steep orography produces standing Rossby gyres that strengthen the cross-terminator jet and align vertical uplift with the day--night boundary. These new circulation regimes enhance moisture transport, increasing the infrared optical depth and promoting additional nightside cloud formation, which produces a stronger cloud-greenhouse feedback and lower the critical fluxes required for global planetary deglaciation. Broad, elevated plateaus drive a similarly fragmented but slightly weaker circulation, yielding less effective moisture transport. These results show that the relief and spatial distribution of landmasses, parameters unconstrained for most exoplanets, can exert strong controls on the climatic bifurcations of tidally locked M-dwarf exoplanets."}
