The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides\na natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical\nsimulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and\nREBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues\nembedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an\n$Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either\nan extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form\nKuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk\ninteractions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar\nencounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with\nejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for\nencounter inclinations between $0^{\\circ}$ and $30^{\\circ}$, giving rise to\ndistinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,\nand a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar\nencounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys\nredistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer\npopulations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that\ncometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of\nplanet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the\narchitecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments."}

Several studies have explored LNSS architecture\nusing geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing\nLNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using\nanalytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south\npole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs)\nand lacks comprehensive optimization approach.

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary\nmulti-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar\norbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation\nperformance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous\nstation-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS\nintegration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse\nset of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV\nrequirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen\nelliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with\nacceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less\nthan 0.4 km/s per satellite per year.

This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of\nso-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended\ngas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching\nconsequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing\ntreatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the\nemergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their\nmorphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental\nconditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain\nsynthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.\nWe find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with\na \"cloudlet\" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the\nfall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a\ntimescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form\nnaturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such\nencounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous\ndetection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for\na disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
