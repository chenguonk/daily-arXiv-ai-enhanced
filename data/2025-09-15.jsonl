Spectroscopic phase curves\nprovide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature\ndistributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different\npressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an\nultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron]\ncaptures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on\norbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global\nenergy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H\ncaptured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved\nregions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures\nof T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond\nalbedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon\n= 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with\nenergy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer\npressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow\nwinds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter\noptical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g\n= 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained\ntrend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We\nalso detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron,\nconsistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths\npotentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets."}

We compared\nsynthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and\nEvolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial\nvelocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the\ncompleteness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical\ncomparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our\nnominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets:\ntwo main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a\nbimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean\nmultiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining\ndiscrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For\ninstance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too\nmany planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative\nexcess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average\ntoo low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a\nmetallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall\ntoo close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us\nto find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for\nwhich we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical\nprocesses appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits\nthan our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower\ndisc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical\nmodels should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and\nfuture large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems.\n(Abridged.)"}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented\nperihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals\nthat it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\\rm H} \\gtrsim\n20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\\rm H} \\gtrsim 16$\nau, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period\ncomets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite\nthe inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not\nbeen observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances.\nWe speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation\nand/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma\nindicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the\nprimary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane\nangle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period,\nindicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity\ntrend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many\nother solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus\nradius to be $\\gtrsim\\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined\nthe orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet.\nOur N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that\nthe comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\\gtrsim\\!60$ au\nfrom the Sun $\\gtrsim\\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be\nlost from our solar system after the current apparition."}

Makarov", "Michael Efroimsky"], "title": "Initial conditions for tidal synchronisation of a planet by its moon", "comment": null, "summary": "Moons tidally interact with their host planets and stars. A close moon is\nquickly synchronised by the planet, or becomes captured in a higher spin-orbit\nresonance. However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter\nits rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation\nbecomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into\nplay and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet\nby its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system\nand can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the\nangular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no\ndependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It\nis applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to\nthe cases of initially retrograde motion. We present calculations for specific\nplanet-moon systems (Earth and the Moon; Neptune and Triton; Venus and its\nhypothetical presently-extinct moon Neith; Mars, Phobos, and Deimos; Pluto and\nCharon), to constrain the dynamically plausible formation and evolution\nscenarios. Among other things, our analysis prompts the question of whether\nPluto and Charon evolved into their current state from an initially more\ncompact configuration (as is commonly assumed) or from a wider orbit -- a topic\nto be discussed at length elsewhere. Our results are equally applicable to\nexoplanets. For example, if asynchronous close-in exoplanets are detected, the\npossibility of tidal synchronisation by an exomoon should be considered."}

The absence of a detectable\ncometary xenon signature in the present-day Martian atmosphere suggests that\nthe capture of solar nebular gas was significant enough to dilute later\ncometary contributions. By quantifying the mass of cometary material\nefficiently retained on Mars, we place a lower bound on the mass of the\nprimordial Martian atmosphere. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we\nuse cometary bombardment data from two independent studies conducted within a\nsolar system evolutionary model consistent with its current structure. Our\ncalculations show that, even under the most conservative scenario, the minimal\nmass of the primordial martian atmospheres would yield a surface pressure of no\nless than 2.9 bar. Such a massive nebular envelope is consistent with recent\nmodels in which atmospheric capture is strongly enhanced by the presence of\nheavier species on Mars - due to outgassing or redox buffering with a magma\nocean."}
