Project Overview and General Characteristics of Detected Comets", "comment": "Accepted for publication on ApJS (20 Aug 2025)", "summary": "We present the first results from the COSINE (Cometary Object Study\nInvestigating their Nature and Evolution) project, based on a uniformly\nprocessed dataset of 484 comets observed over the full 15-year duration of the\nWISE/NEOWISE mission. This compilation includes 1,633 coadded images spanning\n966 epochs with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) greater than 4, representing the\nlargest consistently analyzed infrared comet dataset obtained from a single\ninstrument. Dynamical classification identifies 234 long-period (LPCs) and 250\nshort-period comets (SPCs), spanning heliocentric distances of 0.996--10.804\nau. LPCs are statistically brighter than SPCs in the W1 (3.4 um) and W2 (4.6\num) bands at comparable heliocentric distances. Cometary activity peaks near\nperihelion, with SPCs exhibiting a pronounced post-perihelion asymmetry.\nMulti-epoch photometry reveals that SPCs show steeper brightening and fading\nslopes than LPCs. The observing geometry of WISE/NEOWISE -- constrained to a\nfixed ~90-deg solar elongation from low-Earth orbit -- introduces systematic\nbiases in the sampling of orientation angles for extended features.\nCollectively, the results reveal a continuous evolutionary gradient across\ncomet populations, likely driven by accumulated solar heating and surface\nprocessing. This study establishes a foundation for subsequent COSINE analyses,\nwhich will separate nucleus and coma contributions and model dust dynamics to\nfurther probe cometary activity and evolution."}

Apparent variations due to systemic motion and light travel\ntime effects have been ruled out, indicating that the observed changes are\ndynamical in origin. Joint modeling of the TrES-1 b data favors an apsidal\nprecession model, but the rapid precession rate of $4^\\circ$ yr$^{-1}$ cannot\nbe explained without invoking an undetected close-in planetary companion, which\nremains unseen in the data. While radial velocity measurements reveal a\npreviously undetected companion candidate on a wide, eccentric orbit, it is\nunlikely to drive the observed evolution of TrES-1 b. However, an orbital decay\nmodel provides a plausible alternative if the loss of orbital energy is driven\nby planetary obliquity tides. We find that the best-fit orbital decay rate of\n$-7.1^{ +1.5}_{-1.6}$ ms yr$^{-1}$ is aligned with theoretical predictions for\nmodified tidal quality factors of hot Jupiters if TrES-1 b has a planetary\nobliquity $\\varepsilon_p > 30^\\circ$. We encourage follow-up observations of\nthis system, particularly of eclipse timing and radial velocities, to further\nconstrain the nature of the observed evolution. This paper provides a practical\nframework for studying secular variations and aims to accelerate future\nresearch on similar systems."}

In this study, we aim to model the possibility\nfor mineral cloud formation in the atmosphere of sub-Neptunes from outgassing\nof refractory species at the magma surface. In our specific cases, we find that\nmineral clouds easily form near the magma-atmosphere boundary, but also higher\nin the atmosphere once vapour is mixed to the cooler atmospheric regions. We\nfind that the vertical cloud structure depends on the mixing profile of the\natmosphere, with stronger mixing allowing particles to remain lofted in the\natmosphere, while weak to moderate mixing produces larger, more sedimented\ncloud particle profiles. We suggest that due to the strong thermal feedback\nfrom cloud opacity, clouds may play an important role in the overall structure\nof the interior-surface-atmosphere coupled system in sub-Neptunes, as well as\naffect their observed spectral properties, especially at near-infrared\nwavelengths."}

Lunar elemental abundance maps have been derived using\nX-ray and gamma ray spectroscopy previously but are limited in coverage or have\ncoarse spatial resolution. Here we used X-ray fluorescence line intensity of O,\nMg, Al, Si, Ca and Fe derived from five years of data from the Chandrayaan-2\nLarge Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) to generate global O/Si, Mg/Si,\nAl/Si, Mg/Al, Ca/Si and Fe/Si line intensity ratio maps at a resolution of 5.3\nkm/pixel. We have developed an independent data analysis methodology for CLASS,\nbased on open source Python packages. Our analysis shows that the Mg/Al map\nbest represents the geochemical differences between the major terranes,\nconsistent with the findings of the Apollo 15 and 16 X-ray Fluorescence\nSpectrometer (XRS) maps. We have also shown a good correlation of the line\nintensity ratios with the abundance ratios from CLASS using published elemental\nabundance maps. Further, we apply Gaussian mixture models to the Mg/Si vs Al/Si\ndensity maps to map geochemically distinct regions on the Moon that could be of\ninterest for future investigations."}

We limit ourselves to axisymmetric global\nlandslides, and take the primordial shape of the body to also be axisymmetric.\nThe landslides are modeled through depth-averaging, while also incorporating\nthe effect of the body's rotation, topographical changes due to multiple\nlandslides, the body's non-uniform gravity field and possible surface mass\nshedding. The body's rotational dynamics is coupled to its shape change due to\nlandsliding, and also includes the action of radiation torque. We utilize our\nmodel to investigate regolith motion on actual asteroids. We then study the\nevolution of the shape and spin state of an initially spherical rubble asteroid\ndue to impact-induced global landsliding events over its lifetime. We find that\nrotational fission is suppressed by regolith redistribution to the body's\nequator by landsliding.

Unfortunately for terrestrial\nobservers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the\nSun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering\nobservation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible.\nWith a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the\necliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will\npass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary\nspacecraft.
