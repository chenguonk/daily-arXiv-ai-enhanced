Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across\nsemimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane\nthat we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our\nresults are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the\ncelestial sphere. We find a warp relative to the invariable plane at semimajor\naxes of 80 - 400 AU (98% confidence) and 80 - 200 AU (96% confidence), but not\nat 50 - 80 AU or 200 - 400 AU. If it is not spurious, a possible explanation\nfor this warp is an unseen planet in the outer solar system. With $n$-body\nsimulations, we find that a planet with mass between that of Mercury and the\nEarth, semimajor axis in the range 100 - 200 AU, and inclination $\\gtrsim\n10^{\\circ}$ to be the most likely cause of the warp; however, parameters\noutside of these ranges are still possible. Such a body is distinct in both\nmass and semimajor axis from the various versions of an unseen planet invoked\nto explain apsidal clustering in the outer solar system. The Vera C. Rubin\nObservatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to confirm or\ndeny the existence of the warp reported here, and might detect the planet that\nmay produce it."}

The Hot Rocks Survey aims to address this question by\nobserving 9 rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs with MIRI emission photometry to\nconstrain the onset of atmospheres. In this paper, we present two MIRI F1500W\n(15$\\mu$m) eclipses of LTT 3780 b, an ultra-short period super-Earth ($P=0.768$\nd, $R=1.325 \\,R_\\oplus$, $M = 2.46\\,M_\\oplus$) that receives 111x Earth's\ninstellation, the highest in the survey. We find a combined eclipse depth of\n$312\\pm38$ ppm, which is consistent between different data reduction and\nanalysis assumptions, bolstering our confidence in the eclipse detection. This\neclipse depth is consistent with the thermal emission from a bare rock surface,\nwith a dayside temperature of $T_d=1143^{+104}_{-99}$ K, $98\\pm9$ % of the\nmaximum temperature predicted for a zero albedo, zero heat redistribution\nblackbody. We are able to confidently rule out CO$_2$-based atmospheres down to\n0.01 bar surface pressure to greater than 3$\\sigma$ (ruling out an\napproximately Mars-like atmosphere). We are unable to rule out a pure H$_2$O 1\nbar atmosphere, though we argue that this composition is unlikely on such a\nhighly irradiated planet, nor O$_2$ atmospheres due to the lack of features in\nthe bandpass, though we can put constraints on CO$_2$-mixture atmospheres. As a\npotential bare rock, we consider a variety of surface composition models, but\nare unable to distinguish between them. However, LTT 3780 b is an excellent\ntarget for follow-up JWST observations to determine its surface composition and\nrule out additional atmospheric compositions."}

We present high-resolution ALMA Band 3 and 4\ncontinuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable,\nreconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images\nreveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact,\ncrescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at\n30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the\nVLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial\nwidth comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately\nefficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface,\nbased on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately\nflared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T\nTauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical\nperturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion-that may modulate\naccretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These\nfindings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic\naccretion in the structurally mature disk."}

Its very active surface has hot spots produced by volcanic\neruptions popping up at seemingly random locations and times. Characterizing\nthe complex surface of Io requires the highest angular resolution available.\nThis work presents the analysis of Aperture Masking Interferometric\nobservations (at 4.3 um) of Io taken with the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless\nSpectrograph instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. These are the first\nspace-based infrared interferometric observations of a Solar System body ever\ntaken.

Here, new\ndeconvolution methods based on Neural Networks allowed us to obtain reliable\nimages from which a detailed analysis of the volcanically active surface of\nthis moon was performed. Our study characterizes the loci and brightness of\nseveral unresolved volcanoes on the surface of Io, as well as the extended\nemission observed.

This can lead to the creation of an envelope of\nescaping gas along the planet's orbital trajectory, often referred to as a\ntail. When transiting in front of their host star, these tails can not only\nproduce larger depths in the transit light curves, but also introduce\nsignificant asymmetries between ingress and egress. Using the publicly\navailable software Harmonica, we present a method to model the light curves of\ntransiting planets surrounded by extended envelopes of escaping gas, and\nsubsequently infer the shape and size of the latter. We apply this method to\nthe JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of HAT-P-18b, which show pronounced helium\ntail features in its spectroscopic light curve of the metastable helium triplet\nat 10830 \\r{A}. Our model reveals that, in order to fit the observed light\ncurve of HAT-P-18b, the planet must possess a trailing helium tail of\n$15.79^{+1.14}_{-1.05}$ planetary radii.
