Principal\ncomponent analysis reveals that 81\\% of spectral variations can be described by\ntwo components, implying that variability within a single rotational phase is\ninduced by at least three distinct spectral regions. By comparing our data to a\ngrid of Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models, we confirm that the\ntime-averaged spectrum cannot be explained by a single model but require a\nlinear combination of at least three regions. Projecting these models onto the\nprincipal component plane shows that the overall variability is highly\ncorrelated with changes in temperature, cloud coverage, and possibly effective\nmetallicity. We also extract brightness maps from the lightcurve and establish\nNorth-South asymmetry in the atmosphere. A combined multidimensional analysis\nof spectro-photometric variability links the three spectral regions to three\natmospheric layers. Forsterite cloud and water abundance at each level form\nunique harmonics of atmospheric variability observed in different spectral\nbands. Atmospheric retrievals on the time-averaged spectrum are consistent with\nan optically thick iron cloud deck beneath a patchy forsterite cloud layer and\nwith the overall adiabatic curve. We also demonstrate two new analysis methods:\na regionally-resolved spectra retrieval that relies on multi-wavelength\nspherical harmonics maps, and a method to constrain brightness maps using\nDoppler information present in the spectra. Future observations of variable\nbrown dwarfs of higher spectral resolution or spanning multiple rotations\nshould help break mapping degeneracy."}

Such gradients pose a longstanding puzzle for\nmodels of planetary evolution and formation, which predict that vigorous\nconvection would homogenize the interior of gas giants within the first $\\sim\n10^6$--$10^8~\\mathrm{years}$ of cooling. Previous 3D simulations and analytic\npredictions for the propagation of a convection zone into a stable region have\ndemonstrated that the rapid rotation of gas giants can significantly slow\nconvective mixing, but not enough to stop it. Another piece of the puzzle is\nluminosity. Gas giants cool as they age, and with that comes a declining heat\nflux over time. Recent ideas suggest that when this declining luminosity is\ncombined with rotational effects, convection may stall. We explore this\npossibility using 3D hydrodynamic simulations that include both rotation and a\nsurface cooling flux that decreases as $1/t$. Our results demonstrate that,\neven without rotation, a declining luminosity can suppress mixing sufficiently\nto preserve an initial compositional gradient in the deep interior of gas\ngiants.

A second possibility is a thin\nCO2-poor residual atmosphere. However, our study shows that different\natmospheric scenarios can result in a high eclipse depth at 15 microns. It may\ntherefore be hazardous, in general, to conclude on the presence of an\natmosphere from a single photometric point."}

Accepted for publication in Nature Astronomy", "summary": "We report JWST/MIRI 15 $\\mu$m phase curves of TRAPPIST-1 b and c, revealing\nthermal emission consistent with their irradiation levels, assuming no\nefficient heat redistribution. We find that TRAPPIST-1 b shows a high dayside\nbrightness temperature (490 $\\pm$ 17 K), no significantly detectable nightside\nemission ($F_{\\rm b, Night, max}$ = $39_{-27}^{+55}$ ppm), and no phase offset\n-- features consistent with a low-albedo, airless ultramafic rocky surface.\nTRAPPIST-1 c exhibits a lower dayside brightness temperature (369 $\\pm$ 23 K),\nand a nightside flux statistically indistinguishable from that of TRAPPIST-1 b\n($F_{\\rm c, Night, max}$ = $62_{-43}^{+60}$ ppm). Atmosphere models with\nsurface pressures $\\geq$1 bar and efficient greenhouse effects are strongly\ndisfavoured for both planets. TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to possess any\nsubstantial atmosphere, while TRAPPIST-1 c may retain a tenuous,\ngreenhouse-poor O$_2$-dominated atmosphere or be similarly airless with a more\nreflective surface. These results suggest divergent evolutionary pathways or\natmospheric loss processes, despite similar compositions. These measurements\ntightly constrain atmosphere retention in the inner TRAPPIST-1 system."}

Accepted for\n  publication in A&A", "summary": "Giant stars have been shown to be rich hunting grounds for those aiming to\ndetect giant planets orbiting beyond ~0.5 AU. Here we present two planetary\nsystems around bright giant stars, found by combining the radial-velocity (RV)\nmeasurements from the EXPRESS and PPPS projects, and using a Bayesian\nframework. HIP18606 is a naked-eye (V=5.8 mags) K0III star and is found to host\na planet with an orbital period of ~675 days, a minimum mass (Msini) of 0.8 MJ,\nand a circular orbit. HIP111909 is a bright (V=7.4 mags) K1III star, and hosts\ntwo giant planets on circular orbits with minimum masses of Msini=1.2 MJ and\nMsini=0.8 MJ, and orbital periods of ~490 d and ~890 d, for planets b and c\nrespectively, strikingly close to the 5:3 orbital period ratio. Analysis of 11\nknown giant star planetary systems arrive at broadly similar parameters to\nthose published, whilst adding a further two new worlds orbiting these stars.\nWith these new discoveries, we have found a total of 13 planetary systems\n(including three multiple systems) within the 37 giant stars that comprise the\nEXPRESS and PPPS common sample. Periodogram analyses of stellar activity\nindicators present possible peaks at frequencies close to proposed Doppler\nsignals in at least two planetary systems, HIP24275 and HIP90988, calling for\nmore long-term activity studies of giant stars. Even disregarding these\npossible false-positives, extrapolation leads to a fraction of 25-30% of\nlow-luminosity giant stars hosting planets. We find the mass-function\nexponentially rises towards the lowest planetary masses, however there exists a\n~93% probability that a second population of giant planets with minimum masses\nbetween 4-5 MJ, is present, worlds that could have formed by the gravitational\ncollapse of fragmenting proto-planetary disks. Finally, our noise modelling\nreveals a lack of statistical evidence for the presence of correlated\nnoise...(Abridged)"}
