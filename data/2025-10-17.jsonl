Lens Mass and Distance Measurements", "comment": "27 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, submitted to AJ", "summary": "As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace\nRoman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold\nouter planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established\nseveral science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key\nadvantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow\ndetection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman\nmust measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20%\nprecision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that\n>40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that\nthe GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by\ncomparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from\ndetailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing\nevents with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly\n1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass\nand distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for\nRoman-era microlensing science."}

We also find evidence of a third\nouter companion orbiting the K-dwarf NGTS-11. We first detected transits of\nNGTS-11 c in TESS light curves and confirmed them with follow-up transits from\nNGTS and many other ground-based facilities. Radial-velocity monitoring with\nthe HARPS and FEROS spectrographs revealed the mass of NGTS-11 c and provides\nevidence for a long-period companion ($P > 2300$ d; $M_{p} \\sin i > 3.6\nM_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$). Taking into account the two additional bodies in our\nexpanded datasets, we find that the mass of NGTS-11 b ($M_{p} = 0.63 \\pm 0.09\nM_{\\mathrm{Sat}}$; $R_{p} = 0.97 \\pm 0.02 R_{\\mathrm{Sat}}$) is lower than\npreviously reported ($M_{p} = 1.2 \\pm 0.3 M_{\\mathrm{Sat}}$). Given their\nnear-circular and compact orbits, NGTS-11 c and b are unlikely to have reached\ntheir present locations via high-eccentricity migration. Instead, they probably\neither formed in situ or formed farther out and then underwent disk migration.\nA comparison of NGTS-11 with the eight other known systems hosting multiple\nwell-characterized warm giants shows that it is most similar to Kepler-56.\nFinally, we find that the commonly used 10-day boundary between hot and warm\nJupiters is empirically well supported."}

Sharp ring boundaries\nseem indicative of shepherding moonlets, but none have been found. All rings\nlie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly\nthe 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in\nat least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius,\nadding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the\ndynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the\nnon-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin\nchanges of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying\nkey parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to\nresonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been\nobserved. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a\ncentral spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled\nby adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links\nthe body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of\nthe test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally\nassuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between\nnon-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that\nslowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the\nSORs outward, enabling resonant capture. For suitable parameters, a portion -or\nall- of the initial disk can become trapped in the 1/3 SOR with the mass\nanomaly, in dynamically stable low-eccentricity orbits. Although the required\ndisk mass is high ($\\ge 1\\%$ of the central body), long-term collisional\nerosion could reduce it to values that are consistent with observed ringlets."}

Here, we investigated the detectability of exoplanet transits using the\ntelescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft,\nwhich has an effective aperture of only 15 mm. We conducted transit\nobservations of the hot Jupiters WASP-189 b and MASCARA-1 b, collecting data\nfor ten and four events, respectively. The transit signal was detected with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 for WASP-189 b and 8 for MASCARA-1 b for each\nevent. Stacking all events improved the SNR to 40 and 16, respectively. The\ntransit mid-times of each event were measured with a precision of 6 minutes and\nwere consistent with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data to\nwithin 2 minutes. The planet-to-star radius ratio was determined with an\nabsolute precision of 0.004 (6% relative) and agreed with TESS results to\nwithin 0.002 (3% relative). The recent ONC-T and TESS data enabled an update to\nthe planetary ephemerides. We report a 4 sigma discrepancy between the updated\norbital period of MASCARA-1 b and previously reported values.

In\nthis study, we conducted a comprehensive search for exocometary transit\nsignatures within the Kepler light curves, using a machine learning approach\nbased on a neural network trained on a library of theoretical exocomet transit\nlight curves. By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified\ncandidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to\nfiltering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives. Our results are\npresented into three catalogs of increasing ambiguity. The first-tier catalog\nincludes 17 high-confidence exocometary transit events, comprising 7 previously\nreported events and 10 newly identified ones, each associated with a different\nhost star. The second-tier catalog lists 30 lower-confidence events that remain\nconsistent with possible exocometary transits. The third-tier catalog consists\nof 49 more symmetric photometric events that could be either exocometary\ntransits, exoplanet mono-transits, or false positives due to eclipsing binaries\nmimicking transits. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the\ncometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age\ndistribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants. This\nchallenges the general idea of a decline in cometary activity with stellar age\nand underlines the need for further investigation into the temporal evolution\nof exocometary activity in planetary systems."}

Yet, these low-mass\nstars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary\natmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a\nrelatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to\nits Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether\na habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV\nflux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios -\none analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like\nenvironment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate\nthat all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water\non the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ\nsubstantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the\nArchean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under\nintensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the\nsurface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the\ndetection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances\nthe overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth,\npotentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings\nunderscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature\ndetection and a potential protection of surface habitability."}
