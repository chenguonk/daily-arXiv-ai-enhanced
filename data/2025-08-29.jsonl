We examine the water content of accreted material using\nthe oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample,\nwe present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that\nshowed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the\nimpact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred\nelemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our\nresults indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich\nmaterial, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\\approx$15\\%.\nAmongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent\nwith corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be\nambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body,\nwhen considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is\nstatistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass\nfraction of $\\approx$25\\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions,\nwe find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This\nconclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf\npollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case. Pollution in\nH-dominated white dwarfs continues to be more water-poor than in their\nHe-dominated cousins, although the sample size of H-dominated white dwarfs\nremains small and the two samples still suffer a disjunction in the range of\nhost star temperatures being probed."}

However because\nour understanding of the physical processes that govern aerosols is incomplete,\ntheir presence makes the measurement of atmospheric properties, such as\nmolecular abundance ratios, difficult. We show that aerosol particles in\nhighly-irradiated exoplanets experience an additional acceleration due to\nstellar radiation pressure. The strength of this radiative acceleration often\nexceeds the planet's gravity and can approach values of ~10-20x gravity's for\nlow-density planets (typically sub-Saturns) hosting ~0.1--1 micron aerosols.\nSince these highly irradiated, low-density planets are often the best targets\nfor atmospheric characterisation with current instrumentation, radiation\npressure is likely an important process when considering aerosol dynamics. We\nfind that radiation pressure accelerates hazes produced by photochemistry at\nhigh altitudes to faster terminal velocities, causing them to grow more slowly.\nHence, the particles are smaller and have lower mass concentrations in the\npresence of radiation pressure. By simulating haze-like aerosols in a 2D\nequatorial band model, we show that radiation pressure steepens optical slopes\nin transmission spectra, resulting in less muted molecular features in the\nNear-IR and gives rise to a correlation between the strength of radiation\npressure and the molecular feature amplitude. Furthermore, the interaction of\nzonal winds and radiation pressure impacts both the optical slopes and\namplitudes on the individual morning and evening terminators."}

However, limited analyses exist\nconsidering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We\nfill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving\nnonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived\nfrom an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded\nones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation\naddresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M,\nand fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show\nthat as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to\ndevelop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates\nover multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with\neccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold\npericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30%\nhigher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic\nequilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold\nseparation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at\neach pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M\neven with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic\ntides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for\ninteracting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous\nexoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more."}

Additionally, we explore possible outflow morphologies with\nthree-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with an improved\nradiative transfer approach, assessing the He I 10833 A triplet. The helium\nline shows no significant evidence of planetary material at the orbital phases\nobserved in this work, though 3D modeling suggests such a structure could exist\nbelow observational detection limits. We conclude that the atmospheric outflow\nof WASP-52 b can be characterized by an intermediate hydrodynamic escape\nparameter, placing it in a transitional regime between cold outflows forming a\nstream-like morphology and hot outflows forming a tail.
