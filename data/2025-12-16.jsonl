Comments welcome", "summary": "Sun-like stars are known to host a paucity of brown dwarf companions at close separations. Direct imaging surveys of intermediate-mass stars have suggested that the brown dwarf desert may be fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio. Microlensing surveys provide a unique opportunity to investigate the nature of this desert around low mass stars, as microlensing hosts have typical masses of 0.05-0.8 $M_\\odot$. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of homogeneously selected binary-lens microlensing events in the literature, and identify a companion mass-ratio desert at $0.02\\lesssim q\\lesssim0.05$ and projected separations around 1-5 au. We derive a statistically significant truncation to the giant-planet mass-ratio distribution at $q\\simeq0.02$, above which the occurrence rate density drops by approximately an order of magnitude. Due to the possibility that the small number of detected companions in this desert orbit white dwarfs, this mass-ratio desert may be closer to being completely dry around main-sequence stars. Below this desert, we derive a giant-planet ($q>4\\times10^{-4}$) occurrence rate density of $5.8\\pm0.8$% per decade of projected separation. Our analysis furthers the hypothesis that the brown dwarf desert is fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio, separating distinct populations of planetary and non-planetary companions that are likely formed via core accretion and gravitational instability, respectively. The persistence of this desert across stellar types suggests that both gas-giant planets and sub-stellar companions form in a scale-invariant fashion, with planets growing to a maximum of approximately 2% their host masses."}

Accepted for publication in AJ", "summary": "Earth-sized planets transiting M dwarf stars present one of the best opportunities with current facilities for studying the atmospheric and bulk compositions of terrestrial worlds. Here, we statistically validate five new transiting Earth and super-Earth sized planets orbiting M dwarf stars using a combination of light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, multi-color observations from Palomar and Las Cumbres Observatory, high-resolution imaging, and stellar spectroscopy. The sample includes: TOI-5716 b, an Earth-sized planet (R_p = 0.96 $\\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) with a 6.766-day orbit around a metal-poor thin-disk star ([Fe/H] = -0.54 $\\pm$ 0.10); TOI-5728 b, a super-Earth (R_p = 1.31 $\\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) on an 11.497-day orbit; and TOI-5736 b, a larger planet (R_p = 1.56 $\\pm$ 0.07 Rearth) with an ultra-short period of just 0.649 days. We also statistically validate a multi-planet system, TOI-5489, hosting two similarly-sized super-Earths: TOI-5489 b (R_p = 1.40 $\\pm$ 0.05 R_earth) and TOI-5489 c (R_p = 1.28 $\\pm$ 0.07 R_earth) with orbital periods of 3.152 and 4.921 days, respectively. Due to their longer orbital periods, TOI-5716 b and TOI-5728 b both have equilibrium temperatures $\\leq$ 400 K, making them useful test cases for studies of atmospheric mass loss. If TOI-5728 b is confirmed to have an Earth-like bulk composition, it would join the very small sample of rocky planets orbiting mid- to late-M dwarfs that lie below the cosmic shoreline and therefore may have retained high mean molecular weight atmospheres."}

We discover CO fundamental emission indicating the presence of warm fluorescent gas within $\\sim10$ AU of the star. The large discrepancy in CO's vibrational and rotational temperature indicates that CO is out of thermal equilibrium and is excited with UV fluorescence. Our UV fluorescence model gives a best fit of $1150\\,$K with an effective temperature of $450$, $332$, and $125\\,$K for the warm CO gas kinetic temperature within $0.5$, $1$, and $10\\,$AU to the star and a gas vibrational temperature of $8800\\,$K. The newly discovered warm CO gas population likely resides between sub-AU scales and $\\sim\\,10\\,$AU, interior to the cold CO reservoir detected beyond $35\\,$AU with HST STIS and ALMA. The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made. The detection of warm CO raises the possibility of unseen molecules (H$_2$O, H$_2$, etc) as collisional partners to excite the warm gas. We estimated a lower mass limit for CO of $1.25\\times 10^{-7}\\text{M}_{\\oplus}$, which is $10^{-5}$ of the cold CO mass detected with ALMA and HST.

However, many key reactions involving ground- and excited-state sulfur species remain poorly characterized, and current photochemical models rely on networks that lack accurate kinetic data under high-temperature, high-CO2 conditions. We compute kinetic parameters for reactions of ground-state S(3P) and excited-state S(1D) with CO2 under Venus-like conditions. These reactions form SO(3Sigma), SO(1Delta), and CO. The potential energy surfaces reveal intermediates, and temperature-dependent rate coefficients are obtained using a master-equation approach based on the chemically significant eigenvalue method. NASA 7-term polynomial coefficients are also derived for ground- and excited-state S and SO for consistent use in photochemical models. Incorporating these data into the one-dimensional photochemical model XODIAC shows that these reactions exert only a minor influence above 60 km in the Venus atmosphere due to competing pathways. The model agrees with observations for most sulfur-bearing species except S3 and S4. Introducing a 1 ppm near-surface atomic sulfur mixing ratio, representing a possible deep-atmosphere or surface source or accounting for missing sulfur processes, increases S3 and S4 by 1-2 orders of magnitude and improves agreement with measurements. For exo-Venus analogs with stratospheric isotherms and strong stellar irradiation, the new reactions significantly modify the vertical profiles of major sulfur species above 30 km and enhance S(1D) and SO(1Delta) more strongly than in scenarios with only isotherms or only irradiation. These results underscore the importance of accurate excited-state sulfur kinetics and the need for updated reaction networks when modeling Venus and exo-Venus atmospheres."}

Rotational instability of rubble-pile asteroids can trigger mass shedding, forming transient debris clouds that may provide the initial conditions for secondary formation in binary systems. Aims. We investigate the dynamical and collisional evolution of a debris cloud numerically generated around a Didymos-like progenitor, as a representative case for the early formation of Dimorphos. The analysis focuses on the growth and structural properties of clusters composed of centimetre- to decimetre-scale particles. Methods. We perform full-scale simulations of debris evolution around a near-critically rotating asteroid using a cross-spatial-scale approach combined with the discrete element method (DEM). To overcome computational timescale limitations, an equivalent cluster-scale simulation framework is introduced to capture the essential collisional growth processes efficiently. These simulations quantify the efficiency of cluster growth and the structural evoution within the debris cloud. Results. Our simulations reveal that particles shed from a rotationally unstable asteroid exhibit a consistent migration pattern toward low-geopotential regions, which governs the mass distribution and dynamical structure of the debris cloud. The collisional velocity are well described by a Weibull distribution (lambda = 0.0642, k = 1.8349), where low-velocity impacts favor accretion. These collisions enable clusters to grow from centimeter-decimeter scales to meter-sized bodies, developing compact, moderately porous structures (Delta I \\approx 0.8, phi \\approx 0.52). Collisions between meter-sized clusters do not exhibit a bouncing barrier: low-velocity impacts yield Dinkinesh-like shapes, while moderate velocities promote plastic merging and continued growth."}

Thermal emission spectropolarimetry offers complementary sensitivity to these atmospheric characteristics. Previous studies have shown that linear polarization in fixed bandpasses depends on emission angle, temperature profile, and cloud scattering. In this study, we revisit these dependencies, emphasizing the wavelength-dependent effects that shape polarized spectra. We show that thermal polarization spectrum is primarily governed by: (1) a combination of temperature, temperature gradient, and wavelength; (2) cloud particle size; and (3) cloud optical thickness. Using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTES, we simulate polarization spectra from a modeled 1D atmosphere. We find that, for a fixed cloud optical thickness, the polarization exhibits peaks at size parameters near 0.2 and 1. However, the dependence on cloud optical thickness is more pronounced and tends to dominate the broadband polarization. We further show that much narrower polarization features in molecular absorption band, can in principle trace the local temperature gradient at the photosphere of each wavelength. Future low-resolution (resolving power around 100) spectropolarimeter operating at 1-2 micron with sensitivities of 1e-5 would be able to capture these polarization features, and may provide a new diagnostic for breaking degeneracies that commonly affect flux-only retrievals. This work represents an incremental step toward the challenging goal of jointly interpreting atmosphere from both intensity and polarization spectra."}

A detailed analysis shows that the jet was clearly detected on seven nights (2025, August~3, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, and~29). The jet maintains an almost, though not perfectly, constant position angle (PA) throughout these epochs. High-precision PA measurements at a projected distance of 6000~km from the cometary optocenter reveal a periodic modulation centered at ~ 280 degrees, consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precessional motion around the sky-projected spin axis of the nucleus. This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar comet. The derived periodicity of $7.74 \\pm 0.35$ h may imply a nucleus rotation period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 15.48 \\pm 0.70$ h if the jet originates from a single active source near one of the poles. This value is slightly shorter than the period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 16.79 \\pm 0.23$ h derived from the photometric time series.

This study aims to investigate the distribution of micron-sized dust particles in the Flying Saucer (BKLT J162813-243139) in Rho Ophiuchi, leveraging the unique observational conditions of a bright infrared background that enables the edge-on disc to be seen in both silhouette and scattered light at certain, specific wavelengths. As part of the JWST Edge-on Disc Ice program ('JEDIce'), we use NIRSpec IFU observations of the Flying Saucer, serendipitously observed against a PAH-emitting background, to constrain the dust distribution and grain sizes through radiative transfer modelling. Observation of the Flying Saucer in silhouette at 3.29 microns reveals that the midplane radial extent of small dust grains is ~235 au, larger than the large-grain disc extent previously determined to be 190 au from millimetre data. The scattered light observed in emission probes micron sized icy grains at large vertical distances above the midplane. The vertical extent of the disc silhouette is similar at visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths, corroborating the conclusion that dust settling is inefficient for grains as large as tens of microns, vertically and radially."}
