Often too plentiful to be\nexplained by an in-situ planetesimal belt, exozodi dust is usually thought to\nbe transported inwards from further out in the system. There is no consensus on\nwhich (if any) of various proposed dynamical models is correct, yet it is vital\nto understand exozodis given the risk they pose to direct imaging and\ncharacterisation of Earth-like planets. This article reviews current\ntheoretical understanding of the origin and evolution of exozodi dust. It also\nidentifies key questions pertinent to the potential for exozodis to impact\nexoplanet imaging and summarises current understanding of the answer to them\ninformed by exozodi theory. These address how exozodi dust is delivered, its\nsize and spatial distribution, and the effect of its composition on exozodi\nobservability, as well as the connection between hot and warm exozodis. Also\naddressed are how common different exozodi levels are and how that level can be\npredicted from system properties, as well as the features that planets impart\nin dust distributions and how exozodis affect a planet's physical properties\nand habitability.

The\nexoplanet community has tried to refine the way we understand the cosmic\nshoreline in order to provide a consistent tool for establishing the hierarchy\nfor exoplanet observations.

Here, our goal\nis to use an empirical approach to refine the Cosmic Shoreline concept. In\nparticular, we used the data provided by the ExoAtmospheres database, using the\nlargest available sample of exoplanets with confirmed atmospheric detections.\nWe reconcile limitations in the classical shoreline definition by anchoring our\nEmpirical Cosmic Shoreline (ECS) to both Mars and the irradiated super-Earth 55\nCnc e.

Applied to planets orbiting M dwarfs, prime targets for\nhabitable-zone studies, the ECS suggests that a larger fraction retain\natmospheres than predicted by classical models when using standard Ixuv\nestimates.

We used DI to\nretrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from\nradial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024.\nThe brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about\n36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of\nthe Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV\nresiduals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable\nwith existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet\ninjection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind\nplanet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3\nto 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates\nwith an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process\nregression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI\nalgorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to\nstate-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6210\u50cf\uff08DI\uff09\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u7c7b\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u884c\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f20\u7edfDI\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u7c7b\u6052\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528HARPS-N\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u592a\u9633\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\uff08RV\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DI\u6280\u672f\u53cd\u6f14\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "DI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u826f\u597d\uff0cRV\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e3a0.6 m/s\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f>100\u5929\u7684\u884c\u661f\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edfDI\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u661f\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Significant variability is\ndetected in 85 per cent of disks and across all timescales probed, from minutes\nto weeks to years, where the largest flux changes correlate with the longest\ntime baselines, and the infrared excesses persist utterly. While each source is\nidiosyncratic, the overall results indicate the most variable disks correlate\nwith those that are the brightest (dustiest), and also among those with\ndetected gas, demonstrating both dust and gas are produced via ongoing\ncollisions. There is a correlation between flux and colour changes, where disks\ntend to appear redder when dimmer and bluer when brighter, consistent with an\nexcess of small dust grains produced in collisions, followed by a gradual\nreturn to equilibrium. The overall results are a drastic departure from the\npredictions of the canonical - geometrically thin, optically thick - disk in\nboth flux and colour, but are broadly consistent with collisional evolution\nbased on a simple model.

One source of insight into HJ\nformation mechanisms is to trace their dynamical histories through measurements\nof host stellar obliquities via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Here we\npresent measurements of the RM effect for the HJs TOI-3714 b and TOI-5293 A b\nusing the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. Our measurements represent just\nthe second and third hot Jupiters around M dwarfs (HJMD) with a detection of\nthe RM effect.

Both stars are in wide binary systems.\nWe refine the stellar parameters by decontaminating their unresolved $K_s$-band\nphotometry and constrain the binary orbits using Gaia DR3 astrometry. We find\nthat the minimum mutual inclination of the planet and binary companion in the\nTOI-5293 system is sufficiently large to drive Kozai-Lidov (KL) migration while\nthe result for TOI-3714 is inconclusive. We present a population-level analysis\nof HJs around AFGK versus early M dwarfs and argue that KL migration is more\nefficient around the latter, which is expected to produce misaligned stellar\nobliquities in HJMD systems in the absence of efficient tidal damping. The\nemerging population of well-aligned HJMD hosts supports the expectation that M\ndwarfs, with their deep convective envelopes, do efficiently dampen misaligned\nobliquities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671fM\u77ee\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\uff08HJs\uff09\u6bd4AFGK\u6052\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u5c112-3\u500d\uff0c\u8868\u660eHJs\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u6210\u6216\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Rossiter-McLaughlin\u6548\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cfTOI-3714 b\u548cTOI-5293 A b\u7684\u5bbf\u4e3b\u6052\u661f\u503e\u89d2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u652f\u6301M\u77ee\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u6709\u6548\u963b\u5c3c\u503e\u659c\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6052\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e9\u671fM\u77ee\u661f\u4e0eAFGK\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gemini-North/MAROON-X\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u6d4b\u91cfTOI-3714 b\u548cTOI-5293 A b\u7684Rossiter-McLaughlin\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6052\u661f\u503e\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Gaia DR3\u5929\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u53cc\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u3002", "result": "TOI-3714\u548cTOI-5293 A\u7684\u6052\u661f\u503e\u89d2\u5747\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u03bb=21\u00b0\u548c-12\u00b0\u3002TOI-5293\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u661f\u4e0e\u53cc\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u76f8\u4e92\u503e\u89d2\u8db3\u4ee5\u9a71\u52a8Kozai-Lidov\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "M\u77ee\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u6709\u6548\u963b\u5c3c\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5bbf\u4e3b\u6052\u661f\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u652f\u6301Kozai-Lidov\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u65e9\u671fM\u77ee\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}
