Under review at ApJ. Comments welcome!", "summary": "A widely explored pathway for hot Jupiter (HJ) formation is high-eccentricity migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles induced by an exterior companion. However, for a distant or low-mass companion, this mechanism typically demands that the planet's initial orbit be very nearly perpendicular to that of the companion. In previous work (Yang et al. 2025), we demonstrated that such fine-tuning can be circumvented in the HAT-P-7 system due to the presence of an intermediate body that efficiently couples the orbits of the planet and the distant companion -- a mechanism we termed the eccentricity cascade (EC). In this work, we analytically characterize the dynamics governing the EC and delineate the parameter space within which it effectively operates. Our qualitative results are as follows: (i) The proto-HJ's eccentricity is most efficiently excited when the inner triple is on the verge of dynamical instability, (ii) the addition of a distant fourth body allows this instability to be approached gradually, and (iii) the instability mechanism is closely related to the stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets in binaries. By deriving an analytic criterion for S-type instability, we obtain closed-form expressions describing the onset of the EC. Our results show that efficient HJ formation via the EC occurs across a broad range of intermediate perturbers, highlighting its potential as a robust migration channel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u504f\u5fc3\u7ea7\u8054\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u9053\u4e25\u683c\u5782\u76f4\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u884c\u661f\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u9053\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u4f34\u661f\u51e0\u4e4e\u5782\u76f4\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u5fc3\u7ea7\u8054\u673a\u5236\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5fc3\u7ea7\u8054\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcS\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97EC\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5185\u4e09\u91cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u7f18\u65f6\uff0c\u539f\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6fc0\u53d1\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u6dfb\u52a0\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b2c\u56db\u4f53\u53ef\u6e10\u8fdb\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dS\u578b\u884c\u661f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u5fc3\u7ea7\u8054\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6270\u52a8\u4f53\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f62\u6210\u70ed\u6728\u661f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u8fc1\u79fb\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u5bf9\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8-\u884c\u661f\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u884c\u661f\u65bd\u52a0\u5728\u76d8\u4e0a\u7684\u529b\u77e9\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d8\u65bd\u52a0\u5728\u884c\u661f\u4e0a\u7684\u529b\u77e9\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6052\u661f\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u4e0e\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6052\u661f\u53cd\u5c04\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u5bf9\u76d8-\u884c\u661f\u8026\u5408\u5404\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5ffd\u7565\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u884c\u661f\u529b\u77e9\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u884c\u661f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cdm=1\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u529b\u77e9\u548c\u6c89\u79ef\u529b\u77e9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u8c10\u6ce2\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u5bf9\u884c\u661f\u529b\u77e9\u548cII\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u5bf9\u76d8-\u884c\u661f\u8026\u5408\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u76d8\u4e0a\u529b\u77e9\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u884c\u661f\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u3002\u95f4\u63a5\u529b\u77e9\u5177\u6709\u632f\u8361\u6027\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u53d1\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Few gas giants have been observed in their accretion phase. ELT instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, allowing detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph with a resolution R = 1e5. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible to METIS, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local NLTE shock-emission calculations. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction, appropriate for gas giants in gaps, and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion. We use resolved photospheric models, and include detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. When the accretion onto PDS 70 b is at its maximum observed strength, the Br a line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum, which is modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, making the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already only the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR = 12 in 4 h, and for the fiducial accretion rate, the line peak will have a per-bin SNR = 28 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 10 min to reach SNR = 3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to ELT/METIS in little integration time.

Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects.\n  From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.\n  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.\n  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5916\u5929\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b43,878\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u5bf9\u989c\u8272\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9c81\u5bbe\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5916\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6548\u5e94\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u89c2\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6697\u5f31\u7ea2\u8272\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408SDSS\u3001Col-OSSOS\u3001DES\u548c\u9c81\u5bbe\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u9996\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u83b7\u5f9743,878\u4e2a\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b9712,852\u4e2a\u7edd\u5bf9\u989c\u8272\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u659c\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u989c\u8272\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u53cc\u5cf0\u6027\u6216\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u5f15\u8d77\u7ea2\u5316\u548c\u84dd\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u9c81\u5bbe\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u6b63\u5728\u5c0f\u76f8\u4f4d\u89d2\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9c81\u5bbe\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u5c06\u6781\u5927\u6269\u5c55\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5916\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u989c\u8272\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

To effectively identify their atmospheric composition, we first must understand their geological evolution. For this study, we focus on enhancing an existing atmosphere-interior exchange model by incorporating additional geological processes relevant to rocky planets. We have extended the model to include the carbon cycle, which enables the model to track four key gas species - CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, and H$_2$ - across four planetary reservoirs: the mantle, plate, ocean, and atmosphere. Major features added include surface temperature calculations which are crucial for the carbon cycle, oxygen fugacity as a planetary interior parameter in the model, and oxidation reactions and diffusion-limited escape calculations to the atmosphere portion of the model. We successfully validated the model for Earth and applied this model to study the effect of oxygen fugacity and initial water abundance on TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f. Our results for present-day abundances show that oxygen fugacity significantly affects the partial pressures of H$_2$ and CO$_2$ for all three planets with minor effects for CO on two of the planets. We also found that H$_2$ is strongly dependent on water mass fraction (WMF). The addition of atmospheric processes produced a significant difference in the H$_2$ and CO abundances at present-day. These results highlight the importance of considering interior parameters to be able to further constrain the geological evolution of these planets and effectively put atmosphere observations into context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u6c14-\u5185\u90e8\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u78b3\u5faa\u73af\u7b49\u5730\u8d28\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76TRAPPIST-1\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8ffd\u8e2aCO\u2082\u3001CO\u3001H\u2082O\u548cH\u2082\u56db\u79cd\u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eTRAPPIST-1 d\u3001e\u548cf\u884c\u661f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522bTRAPPIST-1\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9996\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u5927\u6c14-\u5185\u90e8\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u78b3\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u8868\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u6c27\u9038\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6c27\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u6269\u6563\u9650\u5236\u9003\u9038\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u56db\u79cd\u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u6c27\u9038\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u7684H\u2082\u548cCO\u2082\u5206\u538b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u7684CO\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bH\u2082\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6c34\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5927\u6c14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86H\u2082\u548cCO\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u6f14\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c06\u5927\u6c14\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7f6e\u4e8e\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at < 7e11 cm-2 and < 1e11 cm-2, respectively.

Within the realm of deep space exploration, the accuracy of ephemerides is of great importance. Current ephemerides employ a simplified rotation model for Callisto, which this study addresses by proposing a novel dynamical model. This model enhancesthe existing orbital dynamics by integrating Callisto's rotational motions influenced by gravitational torques from the Sun, Jupiter, and other Galilean moons within an inertial frame, capturing the intricate coupling between Callisto's orbital and rotational dynamics. The study establishes a full dynamical model by deriving analytical expressions for this coupling and developing an adjustment model for data fitting using precise orbit determination methods. Furthermore, the influence of tidal effects on Callisto's motion is investigated, considering its multi-layered internal structure. Results demonstrate that the difference between the newly established full model and the model in current ephemerides is on the order of tens of meters. When calculating the impact of different internal structures of Callisto on its orbit, the influence of three-layered and two-layered structures is on the order of meters, suggesting that the development of a high-precision dynamical model requires additional constraints on the internal structure of Callisto. This research provides a novel alternative for a new generation of precise numerical ephemerides for Callisto.

The aim of this study is to clarify under what conditions the observed features of orbital period ratios of super-Earths can be explained, and to identify what causes the dynamical instability of super-Earths captured into resonant chains. We perform N-body simulations for 100 Myr that follow the formation and orbital evolution of super-Earths originating from a ring of planetary embryos at 1 au from the star. The simulations show that super-Earths undergo inward migration in the disk and are captured into mean-motion resonances with their neighbors. As a result, several resonant pairs form a resonant chain. After disk dispersal, some of these chains become dynamically unstable. In such cases, the final distribution of orbital period ratios and their time evolution can be consistent with recent observations. The instabilities of resonant chains are likely triggered by secular perturbations from embryos that remain on outer orbits beyond 1 au, indicating that not only giant planets but also small embryos can disrupt the resonances among inner super-Earths. We therefore further investigate the secular perturbations from outer embryos using analytic formulas and additional orbital calculations. We discuss the conditions required to excite the eccentricities of inner super-Earths on a timescale of about 100 Myr. These conditions include the need for large eccentricities of the outer embryos, as well as constraints on their masses and semimajor axes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u6bd4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u632f\u94fe\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u884c\u661f\u80da\u80ce\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6444\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u90bb\u884c\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u6bd4\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5171\u632f\u94fe\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u8ddf\u8e2a100 Myr\u5185\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4ece1 au\u5904\u7684\u884c\u661f\u80da\u80ce\u73af\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u884c\u661f\u5728\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u5185\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5171\u632f\u6355\u83b7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u5728\u76d8\u4e2d\u5411\u5185\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e76\u88ab\u90bb\u8fd1\u884c\u661f\u6355\u83b7\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u52a8\u5171\u632f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5171\u632f\u94fe\u3002\u76d8\u6d88\u6563\u540e\u90e8\u5206\u5171\u632f\u94fe\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u6bd4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u632f\u94fe\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u6b8b\u7559\u80da\u80ce\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6444\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u80da\u80ce\u9700\u8981\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u534a\u957f\u8f74\u6761\u4ef6\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u7ea6100 Myr\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6fc0\u53d1\u5185\u8d85\u7ea7\u5730\u7403\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u3002"}}

Petit"], "title": "Close-in compact super-Earth systems emerging from resonant chains: slow destabilization by unseen remnants of formation", "comment": "Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Planet formation simulations consistently predict compact systems of numerous small planets in chains of mean motion resonances formed by planet-disk interaction, but transiting planet surveys have found most systems to be non-resonant and somewhat dynamically excited. A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of ~100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u5904\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u5171\u632f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u975e\u5171\u632f\u7684\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u5171\u632f\u94fe\u5728\u7ea61\u4ebf\u5e74\u5185\u53d1\u751f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u8131\u79bb\u5171\u632f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u5904\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u5171\u632f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u975e\u5171\u632f\u7684\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u5171\u632f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u968f\u6052\u661f\u5e74\u9f84\u5728\u7ea61\u4ebf\u5e74\u5185\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542bI\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u80da\u80ce\u751f\u957f\u548cN\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u52305\u4ebf\u5e74\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u884c\u661f\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u5171\u632f\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u6162\u6269\u6563\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76d8\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u90fd\u5904\u4e8e\u5171\u632f\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u540e\u5f00\u59cb\u7f13\u6162\u6269\u6563\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6570\u5343\u4e07\u5230\u6570\u4ebf\u5e74\u5185\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6c47\u805a\u8fc1\u79fb\u9677\u9631\u7684\u76d8\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b26\u5408\u5a01\u5e03\u5c14\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7fa4\u4f53\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u5171\u632f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5171\u632f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5269\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7684Gyr\u5e74\u9f84\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u76d8\u8017\u6563\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u65e9\u671f\u673a\u5236\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $\u03b1\\sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\\sim$ 32$^\\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\\sim$15$^\\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\\circ$ to 30$^\\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them.

An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\\pm0.14 R_{\\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($\u03c1_{\\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($\u03c1_{\\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\\rm c}=14\\pm3 M_{\\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u786e\u8ba4TOI-1422\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9897\u51cc\u661f\u884c\u661fTOI-1422 c\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e9a\u6d77\u738b\u661f\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f34.563\u5929\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u53cd\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5185\u884c\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u800c\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u8fd8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5185\u884c\u661f\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u6709\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u9897\u884c\u661f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u7ea629\u5929\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u51cc\u661f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u9897\u4f34\u661f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u786e\u8ba4TOI-1422\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9897\u884c\u661f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408TESS\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u51cc\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6247\u533a\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u548c\u5b58\u6863\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9897\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u51cc\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u661f\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9897\u51cc\u661f\u884c\u661fTOI-1422 c\uff0c\u534a\u5f84\u4e3a2.61\u00b10.14\u5730\u7403\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf14\u00b13\u5730\u7403\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f34.563\u5929\u3002\u5185\u884c\u661fTOI-1422 b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e3a0.93 g/cm\u00b3\uff0c\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e3a4.3 g/cm\u00b3\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53cd\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5185\u884c\u661f\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e45\u5ea6\u8fbe5\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "TOI-1422\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u53cd\u5e8f\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u9760\u884c\u661fc\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u9897\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u8f68\u9053\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002"}}

Both observations detect dust continuum emission and the ALMA observations detect the 12CO J=3-2 line from the circumstellar disk. We do not detect SiO, a potential indicator of giant collisions, but place a limit on the total SiO mass in the system. Unlike previously observed in the infrared, we do not find evidence for variability at millimeter wavelengths when comparing the ALMA continuum observations from 2024 to the pre-collision SMA observations from 2014. We perform modeling of the CO and continuum visibilities and find that both the CO and dust are marginally spatially resolved and are contained to within 20 au from the central star. The modeling of the CO suggests that the outer regions of the disk are gas rich, although further observations are needed to confirm the total gas mass. The evolutionary state of this system has been debated in the literature, and our observations, while not definitive, are generally consistent with the idea that this disk is similar to an evolved protoplanetary or transition/hybrid disk. This could suggest that collisions in the terrestrial planet zone of HD 166191 are occurring while the disk is in a transitional phase, where the inner few au are depleted of gas. This makes HD 166191 an important object for understanding the transition between protoplanetary and debris disks and the stages at which collisions occur.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9HD 166191\u76d8\u8fdb\u884cALMA\u548cSMA\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230SiO\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230CO\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u5c18\u57c3\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u90fd\u5c40\u9650\u572820 au\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5411\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u8fc7\u6e21\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76HD 166191\u76d8\u4e2d\u6700\u8fd1\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53d1\u751f\u7c7b\u5730\u884c\u661f\u5e26\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u78b0\u649e\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u76d8\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ALMA\u6ce2\u6bb57\u548cSMA\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u548c12CO J=3-2\u8c31\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bf9CO\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230SiO\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230CO\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u57282014-2024\u5e74\u95f4\u65e0\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c18\u57c3\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u90fd\u5c40\u9650\u572820 au\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5916\u76d8\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u5bcc\u542b\u6c14\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "HD 166191\u76d8\u53ef\u80fd\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u6216\u8fc7\u6e21/\u6df7\u5408\u76d8\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7c7b\u5730\u884c\u661f\u5e26\u78b0\u649e\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u76d8\u5185\u51e0au\u6c14\u4f53\u8017\u5c3d\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5411\u788e\u7247\u76d8\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u78b0\u649e\u53d1\u751f\u9636\u6bb5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}
