Our analysis isolates and quantifies the\nimpact of recent physical advances motivated by detailed modeling of Jupiter\nand Saturn, including updated hydrogen-helium and heavy-element equations of\nstate, helium rain, \"fuzzy\" cores, and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous envelopes,\nalongside improved atmospheric boundary conditions that incorporate ammonia\ncloud physics. We first examine the influence of each new physical ingredient\nindividually, then construct combined baseline models for masses between 0.3 to\n4 Jupiter masses to assess their collective effect on planetary structure and\nobservable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state\nand realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes\nsubtle, differences (~5 to 10%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the\ntreatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and\natmospheric compositions (by ~5 to 20%). These updated physical processes must\nbe incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to\nachieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations."}

Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all\nexoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We\nre-reduce all available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where\ncompanions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\\mu$m K-band contrast spectra.\nWe then derive stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references that\nwe use to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely\nfrom the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extract spectral types, spectral\nindices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the\nhelp of age constraints from the literature, we also derive isochronal masses\nfor most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R\n~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T\nspectral type, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition,\na shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type\ndwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the\nobjects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\\pm$0.15 dex. The derived\nisochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where\navailable, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported\npotential underluminosity. Medium resolution spectroscopy of substellar\ncompanions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the\ncloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects'\nbolometric luminosity which can yield measurements of their formation entropy\nif combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY\nastrometry."}

We investigate the hypothesis that the\nnarrow structure of this circumbinary disc is sculpted by the gravitational\ninfluence of one or more unseen polar circumbinary planets. We first establish\nthe theoretically viable parameter space for a sculpting planet by considering\ndynamical stability and clearing mechanisms, including the chaotic zone, Hill\nradius, diffusion, and polar alignment timescales. We then use $N$-body\nsimulations to test three specific architectures: a single planet interior to\nthe disc, a single planet exterior, and a two-planet system bracketing the\ndisc. Our simulations demonstrate that single-planet models are insufficient to\nreproduce the observed morphology, as they can only truncate one edge of the\ndisc while leaving the other dynamically extended. In contrast, the two-planet\nshepherding model successfully carves both the inner and outer edges, confining\nthe debris into a narrow, stable polar ring consistent with observations. We\nconclude that the structure of the 99 Her debris disc is most plausibly\nexplained by the presence of two shepherding, polar circumbinary planets. We\npresent a specific, testable model for this unique system, which elucidates the\npivotal role of planetary bodies in sculpting the architecture of debris discs."}

Missions like the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects\nmore easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As\npart of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric\nabsorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be\nbased on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data\ngenerated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the\nclimate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS).\nIn this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of\nsimulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of\nthe planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to\nidentify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed\nto improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so\nthat planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric\nabsorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better\nunderstanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and\nhabitability."}

This field is now\nmoving from the gas giant planets towards the smaller and colder telluric\nplanets, and future instruments like ANDES will focus on the observations of\nthe atmosphere of telluric planets in the habitable zone in reflected light.\nThese future observations will possibly find variable signals due to the view\nof different hemispheres of the planet. Particularly, the strength of the\nsignal may be linked to the thickness of the atmospheric layer probed, and\ntherefore to the average altitude variations of the planetary surface, that are\nrelated to the global geodynamic evolution of the planet. To better prepare for\nthe interpretation and exploitation of these future data, we used Mars as a\nSolar System analog of a spatially resolved telluric exoplanet. We observed the\nreflected light of Mars with the high-resolution near-infrared (NIR)\nspectrograph GIANO-B (widely used in exoplanetary atmospheric studies) during a\n3 month period: we studied the spatial and temporal variations of the Martian\nCO2 signal using the least-squared deconvolution technique (LSD), to mimic as\nclosely as possible the standard exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. We linked\nthe variations found to the well-known Martian geological surface\ncharacteristics: we found a clear dependence of the strength of the CO2 signal\nwith the thickness of the Martian atmospheric layer by comparing the retrieved\nCO2 signal with the altitudes of our pointings. The proposed strategy is\npromising: it proved to be effective on Mars and may shed light on the\nvariations in the strength of atmospheric signal of telluric exoplanets."}
