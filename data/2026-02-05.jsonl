Turyshev"], "title": "Propulsion Trades for a 2035-2040 Solar Gravitational Lens Mission", "comment": "19 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables", "summary": "The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) enables multipixel imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of a nearby terrestrial exoplanet from heliocentric distances $z\\simeq 650$-$900$ AU, where solar power is negligible and transportation largely sets time-to-first-science. Reaching 650 AU in 20 yr implies a ballistic lower bound $\\bar v_r \\simeq 32.5~{\\rm AU/yr}\\simeq 154$ km/s, motivating propulsion beyond chemical and gravity-assist-only options. We compare close-perihelion solar sailing, fission-powered nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and Oberth-enabled hybrid injection using simple time-to-distance models that isolate the long outbound leg (i.e., excluding architecture-dependent inner-solar-system injection overhead). For solar sailing, $r_p=0.05$ AU requires $σ_{\\rm tot}\\simeq 4.9~\\mathrm{g\\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\\infty\\simeq 105$ km/s and $σ_{\\rm tot}\\simeq 2.3~\\mathrm{g\\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\\infty\\simeq 155$ km/s, placing sub-20 yr sail-only access in an ultra-low-areal-density, deep-perihelion survivability regime. For NEP, a constant-power stage closure shows that a $m_0=20$ t spacecraft with $m_{\\rm pay}=800$ kg and $η=0.7$ reaches 650 AU in ~27-33 yr for $α_{\\rm tot}=10$-$20~\\mathrm{kg\\,kW_e^{-1}}$ (typical optima $P_e\\simeq 0.18$-$0.30~\\mathrm{MW_e}$, thrust of a few newtons). NEP-only sub-20 yr transfers require extremely aggressive assumptions ($α_{\\rm tot}\\lesssim 3~\\mathrm{kg\\,kW_e^{-1}}$ and very-high-$I_{\\rm sp}$, long-life EP), whereas hybrid architectures become plausible for $α_{\\rm tot}\\sim 10$-$15~\\mathrm{kg\\,kW_e^{-1}}$ if an injection stage supplies $v_0\\gtrsim 50$-70 km/s prior to NEP cruise. We map these requirements to technology readiness and identify system-level demonstrations needed by the early 2030s for a credible 2035--2040 start."}

Resubmitted to MNRAS based on Reviewer Comments. 2 accompanying animations available at https://github.com/haydenmonk/Hyperbolic_Orbit_Animations", "summary": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers such as 1I/`Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS have highlighted the necessity of understanding the dynamical pathways that eject small bodies from planetary systems into hyperbolic trajectories. In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $β$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber."}
