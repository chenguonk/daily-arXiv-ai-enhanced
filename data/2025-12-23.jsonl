It is however uncertain to what extent the radiation's short-term variability contributes to these effects. We are interested in what this variability might imply for planets around M dwarf stars, and focus on Proxima Centauri (Prox Cen) for three reasons: it is an active M dwarf with high levels of variability; it hosts a likely terrestrial exoplanet within its habitable zone (HZ) that will be a prime target for future direct imaging; its proximity has led to extensive observations. We set out to produce time-resolved XUV spectra of Prox Cen that will serve as input to atmospheric models, and to characterize the intrinsic variability of the star. We analyzed the entire dataset of archival XMM-Newton observations for Prox Cen. To derive the time-resolved X-ray spectra, we implemented a new pile-up correction, a new adaptive time-binning algorithm, and a time-dependent plasma model selection. The estimated EUV spectrum is based on a published template, that we scale with proposed relationships between X-ray and EUV fluxes. We produced spectra of Prox Cen from 1 to 920 Angstrom over ~260 ks of observations with unprecedented time resolution. The instantaneous X-ray flux of Prox Cen varies between about 20 times and one-fifth of the average value over the available baseline, with significant differences between wavelengths. We further quantify how variability affects the estimated average flux when a limited number of snapshots (each typically of 30 ks exposure) are available, as is common in X-ray surveys. Future investigations of the atmospheres of Prox Cen b should fold in the time variability and uncertainties described here."}

Such systems, however, offer a unique perspective on the stochasticity intrinsic to planet formation and evolution -- particularly in twin binary star systems, which consist of near-equal-mass stars formed contemporaneously in the same birth environment. The WASP-94 system, which includes twin F-type stars, is a striking exemplar of such systems, containing two hot Jupiters: WASP-94 Ab is a transiting, spin-orbit misaligned giant planet with a 4-day orbital period, while WASP-94 Bb is non-transiting and has a tighter 2-day orbital period. In this work, we leverage N-body simulations to show that the current double hot Jupiter configuration of the WASP-94 system can be reproduced through mirrored von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration. The upcoming Gaia astrometric data releases offer the potential to search for additional twin planetary systems, including double cold Jupiter systems that may serve as the progenitors for WASP-94-like configurations."}

Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact ``technosignatures'') could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1--9~GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25~hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \\texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \\texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$~W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey."}

We assess how much mass loss is required to produce plausible non-gravitational acceleration solutions and compare with estimates of the mass loss. We find that they are consistent when the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is around 1 km in diameter. For a recent solution with a time lag in the acceleration from Eubanks et al, we find diameters between 820 meters and 1050 meters, assuming an outgassing asymmetry factor $ζ=0.5$ and a density of the comet nucleus $ρ=0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$. The limits on the diameter scale as $(ζ/ρ)^{1/3}$. Substantial extrapolation is required in general to compare non-gravitational accelerations to mass loss rates, so reliable estimates of the mass loss rate at other stages of the comet's trajectory will substantially reduce the systematic uncertainty in this estimate."}

We present high-resolution total- and polarized-intensity Ks-band images of the LkCa~15 system obtained with SPHERE using near-simultaneous reference-star differential imaging (star-hopping), yielding self-subtraction-free images beyond 0.1 arcsec. LkCa~15 hosts a ~160 au protoplanetary disk and has previously been reported to harbour candidate protoplanets at separations of 15--18 au. We analyse the disk morphology and dust properties and search for super-Jupiter planets beyond 20 au. We first model the near-infrared scattered-light images together with ALMA submillimetre continuum data using RADMC-3D and a two grain-size (micron and millimetre) compact olivine model. While this model broadly reproduces the disk geometry, it overpredicts the degree of forward scattering in the near-infrared. To investigate this discrepancy, we extract the scattering phase function S(theta) and polarized fraction P(theta) from the SPHERE data and compare them with aggregate-scattering models. The observed phase functions disfavour compact Mie spheres and are better matched by porous aggregates (CAHP). Recomputing the scattered-light models with porous CAHP grains in the disk surface layer significantly improves agreement with the observed Ks-band morphology and polarization, while retaining compact millimetre grains to reproduce the ALMA continuum. No new planetary companions are detected; we place upper mass limits of ~1.5 MJ beyond 200 au and ~3.6 MJ in the inner disk. Our results demonstrate that combining star-hopping imaging with phase-function diagnostics provides strong constraints on dust grain properties in protoplanetary disks."}

Since photometry for most PLATO targets will be extracted on board, an efficient strategy to detect false positives (FPs), defined as transit-like signals not caused by planets, is required. Centroid shifts are a standard FP diagnostic, but only 5% to 20% of PLATO's largest stellar sample (P5) will have centroids computed on board, motivating the need for an alternative strategy. We propose a double-aperture photometry approach to detect FPs, testing two mask types: extended masks, which enlarge the nominal aperture, and secondary masks, centered on the main contaminant. For each mask type, we derive flux and centroid-shift metrics and evaluate their ability to discriminate FPs. Using Gaia DR3, we define P5 targets and their background stars, which are assumed to be eclipsing binaries with transit depths and durations drawn from observed distributions. From simulated photometry and centroid shifts, we compute extended and secondary fluxes as well as extended, secondary, and nominal centroids, and compare their FP detection efficiency. Under these assumptions, approximately 35% of P5 targets have a single FP-producing contaminant and about 22% have two or more. Secondary flux achieves the highest detection efficiency (92%), followed by extended centroid shifts (87%) and nominal centroids (84%). Owing to its lower computational and telemetry cost, double-aperture photometry provides an efficient solution for rejecting a large fraction of FP signals caused by eclipsing binaries."}

Plumes released from this ocean preserve information on its chemical state, and previous analyses suggest weakly to strongly alkaline pH (approximately pH 8--12). Constraining the pH requires identification of pH-sensitive minerals in plume deposits. Several analytical techniques could provide such mineralogical information, but few are practical for deployment on planetary missions. Raman spectrometers, which have recently advanced for \\textit{in situ} exploration and have been incorporated into flight instruments, offer a feasible approach for mineral identification on icy moons. However, their applicability to pH estimation from plume-derived minerals has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluate whether Raman measurements of plume particles deposited on the surface of Enceladus can be used to distinguish between weakly and strongly alkaline subsurface ocean models. Fluids with pH values of 9 and 11 were frozen under vacuum conditions analogous to those on Enceladus. The resulting salt deposits were then analyzed using a flight-like Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra show pH-dependent carbonate precipitation: NaHCO$_3$ and Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 9, whereas only Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 11. These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can distinguish pH-dependent carbonate phases. This capability allows us to constrain whether the pH of the subsurface ocean is weakly alkaline or strongly alkaline, which is a key parameter for assessing its chemical evolution and potential habitability."}

For each planet, we show that moons can remain stable from the Roche limit out to near the theoretical prograde stability boundary at roughly $0.5$ Hill Radii. We quantify how perturbations from neighbouring planets modify these stability limits. Although the overall effect of individual perturbers is generally weak, the combined gravitational influence of the full multi-planet configuration produces a modest contraction of the outer stable radius, notably for \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1 b} and \\texttt{TRAPPIST-1 e}. For each of the seven planets, the outer stability limit for satellites is at 40-45\\% of the Hill radius, consistent with previous work. Using simple long-term tidal decay calculations, we show that the most massive satellites that could survive over Gyr timescales are $10^{-(7-9)} M_\\oplus$ (with higher possible masses for the outer planets)."}

We use LIFEsim, a software developed by the ETH LIFE team, along with thermal emission maps obtained from a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations, to explore the sensitivity of LIFE to the observation geometry. We find that 3 days of observation in broadband would be enough to disentangle the hemispheres of the planet with a 1σ or 3σ confidence level with a baseline or optimistic scenario respectively. Doing the same for a fast-rotator in the habitable zone of a G-class star would be prohibitively challenging. Given enough observation time, the sensitivity of LIFE may allow some spatial resolution of Teegarden's Star b to be achieved, which may directly link to the presence of water clouds and therefore an active hydrology."}

Accepted in AJ", "summary": "We present high-resolution NUV observations from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data for the hottest known gas planet, KELT-9b. Observations were collected with STIS/E230M (2300-3000 $Å$, R$\\sim$ 30,000) and we de-correlate systematic effects from the telescope using jitter detrending. We show the clear presence of the Mg II doublet at 2800 $Å$ and Fe II at 2600 $Å$ in KELT-9b. The Mg II is measured above the planet's Roche transit radius, indicating it is escaping. We fit 1D NLTE atmospheric escape models to these features, demonstrating a significant loss of mass in KELT-9b's atmosphere ($\\dot{M} \\approx 10^{12} $ g/s); we also find a remarkably high line-broadening corresponding to a velocity of about $50-75$ km/s, and a net blueshift of the Mg II doublet greater than 30 km/s. Future 3D MHD modeling of the spectrum and gas kinematics is likely needed to explain these observations. We interpret these results in the context of the Mg II ``Cosmic Shoreline\" and show that the detection of escaping Mg II in KELT-9b and the non-detection in WASP-178b are consistent with the hypothesis that stars hotter than $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sim$ 8250~K have relatively low levels of XUV radiation due to the lack of a chromosphere. Therefore planets around such early-type stars experience a different degree of atmospheric escape. This result highlights the importance of XUV irradiation in driving atmospheric escape inside and outside the Solar System."}
