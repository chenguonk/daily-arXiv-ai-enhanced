Numerical simulations\nhave advanced our understanding of these events, enabling estimations of mass\nand atmospheric loss during the primary impacts. However, high computational\ncosts have restricted investigations to the immediate aftermath, limiting our\nunderstanding of the longer-term consequences. In this study, we investigate\nthe effect of re-accretion of giant impact debris, a process previously\noverlooked, on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Following the\ncollisional and dynamical evolution of the debris ejected during the primary\nimpacts, we quantify the amount of debris that would be re-accreted by the\nprogenitor. We find that $\\sim 0.003\\ M_{\\oplus}$ would be re-accreted over a\nwide range of Earth-like planet properties, assuming $1\\%$ of their mass is\nejected as non-vaporised debris. Over a prolonged period, the secondary impacts\nduring re-accretion drive enhanced atmospheric loss. Notably, the impacts from\nthe debris of the canonical Moon-forming impact would have gradually eroded an\natmosphere similar to present-day Earth's in $\\sim 30$ Myr. More generally, any\nplanet growing via giant impacts within $2$ au is likely to experience\nsignificant post-impact atmospheric erosion unless the initial atmosphere was\nat least $5$ times more massive than Earth's. Our results highlight the crucial\nrole secondary impacts from giant-impact ejecta could have in driving the\nlong-term atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets, and demonstrate that\ngiant impacts can be significantly more effective at eroding such atmospheres\nthan previously thought, when re-accretion of debris is considered."}

The longer orbital periods and transit durations of warm Jupiters\nmake it more difficult to measure the obliquities of their host stars.

As a result, measuring these obliquities is necessary\nto understand how these types of planets form and how their formation and\nevolution differ from that of hot Jupiters.

The goal of this\npaper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain\nalignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of\nlinear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation\nhydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the\nvelocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction\nsimulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and,\nfinally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain\nsynthetic polarimetric observations.

This enhanced dissipation leads to a\nfaster orbital migration of its five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel,\nTitania, and Oberon. Consequently, resonant encounters that have always been\ndiscarded in previous works need to be included. In particular, Ariel's fast\nmigration implies that the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance with\nUmbriel is extremely likely and it could have occurred in recent times. Capture\ninto this strong resonance would have induced significant tidal heating within\nAriel, possibly explaining its resurfacing. Therefore, in this work, we aim to\nexplore the orbital history of the Uranian moons in a context of fast tidal\nmigration, including the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance between\nAriel and Umbriel. For small initial eccentricities, we confirm that the moons\nare always captured into this resonance. As the system is not currently\ninvolved in any mean motion resonance, we investigated possible dynamical\nmechanisms for exiting the 2:1 resonance.

We analyzed the\ncrossing of the 4:2:1 and 3:2:1 resonant chains, and looked for the parameter\nspace where the probability of escaping the resonance is maximized. Taking a\ndissipative parameter of Ariel $k_{2,2}/Q_2<10^{-3}$, the passage through the\n3:2:1 resonance succeeds in disrupting the 2:1 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion\nresonance in more than $60\\%$ of our numerical experiments. A fraction of our\nsimulations results in final low eccentricities and inclinations, which can\neventually match the current orbital features of the system. As the proposed\norbital history requires specific ranges of the dissipative parameters for the\nsystem, future Uranus mission data will validate (or disprove) this scenario."}

Disc turbulence and dust fragility\nmatter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while\nfixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use\nanalytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the\ncombinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce\nmulti-wavelength ALMA observables. We find only appropriate combinations --\nfragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with\nviscous $\\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in\ndiscs with viscous $\\alpha=10^{-3}$ -- can reproduce observations. Our result\nis robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless\nof the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed\ndust rings to be optically thick at $\\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small\ndust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED\nanalysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight\nthe challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when\nincorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust\nrings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius\nobserved across ALMA wavelengths."}

We find that\nhigh mantle temperature, iron content, and melt fraction all suppress the\noverall induction heating efficiency due to increased mantle conductivity and\nmagnetic shielding. In GJ 486b, induction heating likely exceeds both\nradiogenic heating and tidal heating, driving persistent surface volcanism and\nearly volatile depletion, whereas HD 3167b and GJ 357b experience insignificant\ninduction heating due to weak stellar magnetic fields.
