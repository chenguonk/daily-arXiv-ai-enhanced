  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究垂直混合引起的热通量如何影响大气化学，这对于准确模拟和反演系外行星大气成分至关重要。

Method: 通过分析混合诱导的热通量对大气温度的影响，研究不同化学物种在上下层大气中的丰度变化，特别关注淬灭层位置与温度变化区域的关系。

Result: 在强混合条件下，CH₄、H₂O和NH₃的混合比在上下层大气中都减少，而CO、CO₂和NO在低层大气中增加，其中CO和CO₂在上层也增加，但NO减少。较弱的主星辐射使行星整体温度降低，较小的混合就能产生类似效果。

Conclusion: 理解垂直混合热通量对于准确的大气化学建模和反演至关重要。

Abstract: Vertical mixing disrupts the thermochemical equilibrium and introduces
additional heat flux that alters exoplanetary atmospheric temperatures. We
investigate how this mixing-induced heat flux affects atmospheric chemistry.
Temperature increase in the lower atmosphere by the mixing-induced heat flux
alters species abundances there and modifies those in the upper atmosphere
through vertical transport. In the lower atmosphere, most species follow
thermodynamic equilibrium with temperature changes. In the upper layers,
species mixing ratios depend on the positions of quenching levels relative to
the regions exhibiting significant mixing-induced temperature variations. When
the quenching level resides within such region (e.g. CO, $\rm CH_4$, and $\rm
H_2O$ with strong mixing), the mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere are
modified due to changes in the quenched ratios affected by the temperature
variation in the lower atmosphere. This alters the mixing ratio of other
species (e.g. NO and $\rm CO_2$) through the chemical reaction network, whose
quenching occurs in the region without much temperature change. The mixing
ratios of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm H_2O$, and $\rm NH_3$ decrease in the lower
atmosphere with increasing mixing heat flux, similarly reducing these ratios in
the upper atmosphere. Conversely, the mixing ratios of CO, $\rm CO_2$, and NO
rise in the lower atmosphere, with CO and $\rm CO_2$ also increasing in the
upper levels, although NO decreases. Weaker host star irradiation lowers the
overall temperature of the planet, allowing a smaller mixing to have a similar
effect. We conclude that understanding the vertical mixing heat flux is
essential for accurate atmospheric chemistry modeling and retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超旋转是快速旋转气体巨行星、慢速旋转行星体和潮汐锁定行星的常见特征，但不同行星类型的超旋转机制尚未得到系统比较。

Method: 使用包含超旋转主要机制的两层模型，通过线性化和非线性积分分析，研究热罗斯贝数和辐射弛豫时间对超旋转的影响。

Result: 潮汐锁定行星需要松野-吉尔结构、斜压性和低层拖曳共同作用才能产生超旋转；慢速旋转行星的超旋转与罗斯贝-开尔文不稳定性相关；两种机制可以共存。

Conclusion: 研究为不同行星体的超旋转机制提供了统一视图，揭示了从轴对称强迫到潮汐锁定行星的连续过渡机制。

Abstract: Superrotation is a common feature of quickly rotating gas giants, slowly
rotating planetary bodies, and tidally-locked planets. In this paper we compare
and contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and
tidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying
in particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size,
rotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad
(which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model
that contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet
remains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the
behavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a
Matsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is
insufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are
additional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the
superrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in
statistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate:
subrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak
low-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is
always linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps
surprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of
superrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the
continuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from
axisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively
stronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly
dominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing
superrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist. These results provide a
unified view of superrotation mechanisms across a wide range of planetary
bodies.

TL;DR: 分析584颗双子座火流星数据，比较四种数据处理流程在轨迹、速度、辐射点和轨道元素计算方面的差异，发现FRIPON在赤经和初速度估计上存在系统偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同火流星数据处理流程之间的一致性，识别系统偏差来源，为多网络数据融合提供参考。

Method: 处理2016-2023年FRIPON观测的584颗双子座火流星数据，转换为GFE标准格式，使用四种数据缩减流程（WMPL、DFN、AMOS、FRIPON）进行分析比较。

Result: 四种流程的辐射点和速度解都在已发表值范围内，但FRIPON因岁差处理不当导致赤经系统偏移-0.3度，因减速模型问题高估初速度+0.3 km/s。DFN对观测不佳事件预测较低速度。速度不确定性存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: 不同数据处理流程在双子座火流星分析中产生可量化的系统偏差，主要差异体现在速度不确定性估计上，为多网络数据融合提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Methods. We processed a dataset of 584 Geminid fireballs observed by FRIPON
between 2016 and 2023. The single-station astrometric data is converted into
the Global Fireball Exchange (GFE) standard format for uniform processing. We
assess variations in trajectory, velocity, radiant, and orbital element
calculations across the pipelines and compare them to previously published
Geminid measurements.
  Results. The radiant and velocity solutions provided by the four data
reduction pipelines are all within the range of previously published values.
However, there are some nuances. Particularly, the radiants estimated by WMPL,
DFN, and AMOS are nearly identical. Whereas FRIPON reports a systematic shift
in right ascension (-0.3 degrees), caused by improper handling of the
precession. Additionally, the FRIPON data reduction pipeline also tends to
overestimate the initial velocity (+0.3 km s-1) due to the deceleration model
used as the velocity solver. The FRIPON velocity method relies on having a
well-constrained deceleration profile; however, for the Geminids, many are
low-deceleration events, leading to an overestimation of the initial velocity.
On the other end of the spectrum, the DFN tends to predict lower velocities,
particularly for poorly observed events. However, this velocity shift vanishes
for the DFN when we only consider Geminids with at least three observations or
more. The primary difference identified in the analysis concerns the velocity
uncertainties. Despite all four pipelines achieving similar residuals between
their trajectories and observations, their velocity uncertainties vary
systematically, with WMPL outputting the smallest values, followed by AMOS,
FRIPON, and DFN.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过高分辨率光谱分析HD 189733恒星活动，发现热木星HD 189733b在凌星期间穿越活跃区域，可能导致JWST观测中约17 ppm的传输光谱偏差，建议地面高分辨率监测以区分恒星活动与行星大气信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恒星表面不均匀性会污染行星传输光谱测量，影响大气成分的准确检测。需要量化恒星活动对HD 189733b JWST观测的污染程度。

Method: 使用GTC望远镜的MEGARA光谱仪获取HD 189733恒星Hα线的高分辨率光谱，测量凌星期间Hα指数的变化。

Result: 发现Hα指数在凌星中期变浅0.00156±0.00026，表明行星穿越活跃区域，估算出半径约3.47±0.30R⊕的星斑导致约17 ppm的传输深度变化。

Conclusion: 恒星活动可能使JWST NIRCam观测产生偏差，建议同时进行地面高分辨率活动指标监测，以区分恒星活动与行星大气信号。

Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy allows us to detect molecules in planetary
atmospheres, but is subject to contamination from inhomogeneities on the
stellar surface. Quantifying the extent of this contamination is essential for
accurate measurements of atmospheric composition, as stellar activity can
manifest as false atmospheric signals in planetary transmission spectra. We
present a study of hot Jupiter HD 189733b, which has over 50 hours of JWST
observations scheduled or taken, to measure the activity level of the host star
at the current epoch. We utilize high-resolution spectra of the H${\alpha}$
line from the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10-m GTC to examine the activity level
of HD 189733 during a transit. We measure H${\alpha}$ becoming shallower
mid-transit by an H${\alpha}$ index of ${\delta}$ = 0.00156 ${\pm}$ 0.00026,
which suggests that HD 189733b crosses an active region as it transits. We
posit this deviation is likely caused by a spot along the transit chord with an
approximate radius of $R_{spot}$ = 3.47 ${\pm}$ 0.30R${\oplus}$ becoming
occulted during transit. Including an approximation for unocculted spots, we
estimate that this spot could result in transit depth variations of ${\sim}$17
ppm at the 4.3 micron CO2 feature. Since this is comparable to JWST NIRCam
Grism mode's noise floor of ${\sim}$20 ppm, it could bias atmospheric studies
by altering the inferred depths of the planet's features. Thus, we suggest
ground-based high-resolution monitoring of activity indicator species
concurrently taken with JWST data when feasible to disentangle stellar activity
signals from planetary atmospheric signals during transit.
