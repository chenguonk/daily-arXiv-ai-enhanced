In this work, we\nanalyse the morphology of the dust continuum emission of 121 discs from an ALMA\nBand 7 survey of the Upper Scorpius region. This analysis is done in the\nvisibility plane, to measure the flux, geometry and characterise potential\nstructures. We compare the results with state-of-the art gas and dust evolution\nmodels that include external photoevaporation, with mild values of the\n$F_{\\rm{UV}}$ of 1-40$G_0$. From the visibility analysis, 52 of the 121 discs\nare resolved (43%). From the resolved discs, 24 discs have structures and 28\nremain as smooth discs at the mean resolution scale of $\\sim$0.1$^{\\prime\n\\prime}$ (~14au). Our results show no significant dust disc size evolution of\nthe surviving discs in UpperSco when compared to discs in younger star-forming\nregions, such as Lupus. We find a strong, steeper-than-previously-reported\ncorrelation between dust disc size and disc millimeter continuum luminosity, in\nagreement with drift-dominated dust evolution models. We also find positive\ncorrelations between the dust disc mass vs. stellar mass and dust disc size vs.\nstellar mass. The slope of the dust disc size vs. stellar mass relationship is\nsteeper compared to younger star forming regions. Additionally, we observe no\nsignificant correlation between dust disc properties and the environmental\n$F_{\\rm{UV}}$, consistent with models predicting that dust disc properties are\nprimarily shaped by drift and dust traps. Our models predict that gas disc\nmasses and sizes should be highly affected by the moderate $F_{\\rm{UV}}$ values\nthat Upper Scorpius discs experience in contrast to the dust, highlighting the\nneed for deeper and higher-resolution gas observations of these discs exposed\nto mild external photoevaporation."}

Despite ongoing efforts to improve their\nresilience, they remain vulnerable to component damage and deorbiting under\nharsh space weather conditions. Prior work identified a modest but noticeable\nimpact on LEO satellite network performance during solar storms, typically\nmanifesting as an immediate rise in packet loss and a sustained increase in\nround-trip time (RTT). However, these studies offer only coarse-grained\ninsights and do not capture the nuanced spatial and temporal patterns of\ndisruption across the LEO network.\n  In this paper, we conduct a deep dive into the impact of solar storms on LEO\nsatellite communications. By localizing the impact of increased atmospheric\ndrag at the level of individual satellites and orbits, we reveal significant\nheterogeneity in how different parts of the network are affected. We find that\nthe degree of performance degradation varies significantly across geographic\nregions, depending on satellite positioning during the storm. Specifically, we\nfind that (i) not all satellite orbits are equally vulnerable, (ii) within a\ngiven orbit, certain satellites experience disproportionate impact depending on\ntheir position relative to geomagnetic conditions, and (iii) autonomous\nmaneuvering of satellites might be a cause of the sustained increase in RTT.\nOur findings uncover previously overlooked patterns of vulnerability in LEO\nsatellite constellations and highlight the need for more adaptive, region-aware\nmitigation strategies to address space weather-induced network disruptions."}

As an\nalternative mechanism, the direct in-situ formation of planets or planetary\ncores by gravitational instability (GI) in protoplanetary disks has been\nproposed. However, observational evidence for GI in regions where wide-orbit\nplanets are formed is still lacking. Theoretical studies predict that GI\ninduces spiral arms moving at the local Keplerian speed in a disk. Here, with\nmultiple high angular resolution observations over a seven-year time baseline\nusing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report the\nevidence for spiral arms following the Keplerian rotation in the dust continuum\ndisk around the young star IM Lup. This demonstrates that GI can operate in\nwide-orbit planet-formation regions, establishing it as a plausible formation\nmechanism for such planets."}

This effect has been attributed to ``binary hardening,''\nwhereby the binary's orbital period would have gradually decreased as Dimorphos\ncontinuously scattered bound ejecta out of the system and lost angular\nmomentum. We investigated this hypothesis with the goal of constraining the\nconditions that would lead to a gradual decrease in the binary's orbital\nperiod. We used $N$-body simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the\nDidymos system under the influence of a cloud of massive test particles. We\ndemonstrate that the gravitational scattering of ejecta is not a plausible\nexplanation for Dimorphos's anomalous orbital period drop under any\ncircumstances. This is a result of Dimorphos's escape speed being low compared\nto its orbital velocity, making it a weak scatterer. If a significant fraction\nof DART ejecta was launched at low speeds, as impact models and scaling laws\nsuggest, then the binary's orbital period was likely increased as this material\nwas accreted back onto Didymos and Dimorphos.
