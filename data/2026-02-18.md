TL;DR: 使用耦合映射晶格(CML)模拟恒星、盘、臂和伴星形成的动态模型，提出基于中心恒星引力不稳定性和混沌喷射的"臂交叉伴星形成"新机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行星形成理论面临径向漂移障碍和角动量问题，需要探索新的形成机制。本文旨在通过复杂系统方法模拟原行星盘观测中典型天体的动态形成过程

Method: 采用耦合映射晶格(CML)这一复杂系统方法，结合一个欧拉程序模拟引力相互作用导致的气体团块流动形成，和一个拉格朗日程序模拟粘弹性平流导致的气体团块碰撞混合

Result: CML成功模拟出与观测一致的四类典型天体：中心恒星、开普勒盘、螺旋臂、以及恒星、亚恒星和行星伴星。所有形成过程都是动态的，基于中心恒星引力不稳定性和高维混沌气体喷射

Conclusion: 提出"臂交叉伴星形成"新机制，螺旋臂交叉导致密度快速增加形成多样伴星，可能克服径向漂移障碍和角动量问题，为行星形成提供新视角

Abstract: We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.

TL;DR: 首次对半人马座矮星系流进行凌星巡天，未发现热木星，计算了发生率上限，并预测未来需要更多目标星才能探测到系外行星。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前尚未在银河系外探测到系外行星，且其发生率约束较差。研究旨在利用TESS数据对半人马座矮星系流进行首次凌星巡天，约束系外行星在银河系外的发生率。

Method: 使用TESS数据对15,176颗可能成员星进行凌星巡天，计算热木星（半径1-2 R_Jup，周期0.6-10天）的发生率上限，并与银河系球状星团M4和47 Tuc的观测结果进行比较。

Result: 未探测到行星，计算得到热木星发生率上限<1.01%。与银河系球状星团相比，半人马座矮星系流的发生率上限更低（<0.37% vs <0.57%）。预测未来需要至少11,467颗目标星才能探测到系外起源行星。

Conclusion: 未来对TESS数据的分析（包括更多银河系外星流）可能探测到首个系外起源行星，或证明较老、低金属丰度的银河系外环境具有比银河系更低的热木星发生率。

Abstract: To date no exoplanets have been detected outside the Milky Way, and their extragalactic occurrence rates are poorly constrained. Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $<$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$σ$ occurrence rate upper limit of $<$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $<$10 days, is lower than the $<$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $<$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $<$8 days is below the $<$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $η_{extragalactic}$ $\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way.

TL;DR: 首次利用ALMA观测数据反演了木卫一（Io）大气垂直温度剖面，揭示了前导半球存在冷对流层和热增温层结构，而尾随半球大气较薄且接近等温


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 木卫一大气的结构受火山排气、升华、辐射冷却和等离子体加热等多种过程竞争影响，但长期以来缺乏观测得到的温度剖面来约束这些过程的平衡

Method: 使用ALMA四个时期的Band 7和Band 8 SO₂光谱数据，结合多谱线同时分析、视线分辨多普勒速度图和包含亚波束速度弥散项的正演模型，分离热力学和动力学对谱线形状的贡献

Result: 前导半球大气存在冷准等温对流层（约124-137K至0.5nbar），随后热增温层升至数百K（至10⁻²nbar）；尾随半球SO₂柱密度较低，谱线形成局限于前几公里，与等温大气统计一致；气体覆盖率约35-50%，亚波束速度弥散约25-85m/s

Conclusion: 首次获得了木卫一大气的垂直分辨温度剖面，揭示了前导半球日侧存在稳健的垂直结构，为木卫一热能量平衡提供了新的约束条件

Abstract: The structure of Io's atmosphere is controlled by competing processes, from volcanic outgassing and sublimation to radiative cooling and plasma heating. Yet, the lack of an observationally-derived temperature profile has left this balance unconstrained. We used four epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 (275-373 GHz) and Band 8 (385-500 GHz) SO$_2$ spectroscopy to retrieve Io's vertical atmospheric temperature profiles. To mitigate longstanding degeneracies common in atmospheric retrievals, we performed a simultaneous multi-line analysis combined with line-of-sight disk-resolved Doppler velocity maps and a forward model that included a sub-beam velocity-dispersion term. This modeling approach enabled the separation of thermal and dynamical line-shape contributions. On the leading hemisphere, we retrieved a cold, quasi-isothermal lower atmosphere ($\sim$124-137~K up to $\sim$0.5~nbar), followed by a thermospheric rise reaching hundreds of kelvins by $\sim10^{-2}$~nbar. On the trailing hemisphere, our fits yielded qualitatively similar profiles but consistently retrieved lower SO$_2$ column densities. The lower column densities confined line formation to the first few kilometers, making the trailing hemisphere spectra statistically consistent with an isothermal atmosphere. Across datasets, we retrieved fractional gas coverages of $\sim$35-50$\%$ and sub-beam velocity dispersions of $\sim$25-85$\mathrm{~m~s^{-1}}$, encoding line-of-sight velocity dispersion within a beam element in excess of the disk-resolved Doppler velocity map. Together, these retrievals deliver the first vertically resolved temperature profiles of Io's atmosphere, reveal robust vertical structure on the dayside leading hemisphere, and offer new constraints on Io's thermal energy balance.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析流星体碎裂事件，揭示了大气分层对次声波传播的影响，建立了区分源物理与传播伪影的诊断标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流星体碎裂的次声特征经常模糊不清：多个到达信号是复杂的碎裂过程还是大气分层造成的扭曲？解决这一模糊性对于准确估计能量和重建源至关重要。

Method: 使用伪微分抛物线方程（PPE）模拟，量化平流层和低热层中精细尺度重力波结构如何改变300公里范围内的声波波形，并结合南安大略流星网络和Elginfield次声阵列的独特区域数据集进行分析。

Result: 模拟显示精细尺度分层可以拉伸信号并产生扩散的振荡尾部，但在约140公里范围内不会产生离散的高振幅脉冲分裂。通过将这些结果应用于20060305事件，证明其在100公里范围内的明显双重到达与大气多径传播不一致，而是提供了单独碎裂事件的明确证据。

Conclusion: 这些发现建立了区分源物理与传播伪影的新诊断标准，提高了次声作为监测自然火流星、太空碎片再入和灾难性发射失败工具的可靠性。

Abstract: Infrasonic signatures of meteoroid fragmentation are frequently ambiguous: do multiple arrivals signify a complex breakup or merely the distorting effects of a layered atmosphere? Resolving this ambiguity is critical for accurate energy estimates and source reconstruction. In this study, we address this challenge by analyzing a unique regional dataset of well-constrained meteoroid events observed by the Southern Ontario Meteor Network and the co-located Elginfield Infrasound Array. We employ pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) simulations to quantify how fine-scale gravity-wave structures in the stratosphere and lower thermosphere modify acoustic waveforms at ranges <300 km. Our modeling reveals that while fine-scale layering can stretch signals and generate diffuse oscillatory tails, it does not produce discrete, high-amplitude pulse splitting at ranges below ~140 km. By applying these results to the rare multi-arrival event 20060305, we demonstrate that its distinct double arrival at 100 km range is inconsistent with atmospheric multipathing and provides definitive evidence of separate fragmentation episodes. These findings establish new diagnostic criteria for separating source physics from propagation artifacts, improving the reliability of infrasound as a monitoring tool for natural bolides, space debris re-entries, and catastrophic launch failures.

TL;DR: 首次成功记录并回收铁陨石坠落事件，获得了可靠的日心轨道数据，揭示了铁陨石与石陨石在大气层中不同的空气动力学特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铁陨石坠落事件极为罕见，此前从未有可靠的铁陨石进入大气层前的轨道数据。研究旨在填补这一空白，通过多仪器观测首次记录并回收铁陨石，分析其大气层进入过程。

Method: 结合光学、次声波和地震数据重建发光轨迹，使用蒙特卡洛模型模拟黑暗飞行阶段和预测散布场，同时研究反弹的可能性。

Result: 成功回收13.8公斤铁陨石，获得了首个可推导日心轨道的铁陨石数据，记录了有史以来最低的终端高度。分析发现铁陨石具有独特的空气动力学特性，包括流线型形状和深熔蚀坑对阻力和飞行稳定性的影响。

Conclusion: 铁陨石与石陨石在大气层中的行为存在显著差异，需要在进入模型中纳入铁陨石特定参数，以更好地约束大气动力学并改进未来事件的回收预测。

Abstract: Iron meteorite falls are rare compared to stony meteorites, and until recently no iron meteorite had a reliably determined pre-atmospheric orbit. This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near Ådalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition. Our analysis identifies distinct aerodynamic properties of iron meteoroids compared to stony bodies, including the influence of streamlined shapes and deep regmaglypts on drag and flight stability, underscoring the need to incorporate iron-specific parameters into entry models to constrain atmospheric dynamics and improve recovery predictions for future events.

TL;DR: 使用ESPRESSO光谱仪观测WASP-31 b，通过先进方法校正行星遮挡线畸变污染，确认了低自旋轨道角但未检测到大气物种，发现POLD污染仍是高分辨率透射光谱的主要限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热木星是研究大气成分和动力学的理想实验室，但高分辨率透射光谱目前受限于行星遮挡线畸变污染的去除能力。本研究旨在利用ESPRESSO光谱仪观测WASP-31 b，改进污染校正方法，探索其大气特征。

Method: 使用VLT的ESPRESSO光谱仪观测两个半凌星事件；用RM "revolutions"方法分析Rossiter-McLaughlin效应；用molecfit校正地球大气线污染；用EvE模型模拟行星遮挡线畸变污染。

Result: 确认了行星的低天空投影自旋轨道角（λ= -0.09^{+0.31}_{-0.32}度）；未检测到任何大气物种（包括先前报道的K或CrH）；POLD污染或ESPRESSO波长范围缺乏可观测线是主要原因，但不能排除先前检测结果。

Conclusion: 行星遮挡线畸变污染仍然是高分辨率透射光谱的主要限制因素，特别是对于恒星和行星中都存在的物种，即使使用最先进模型也难以检测。在ELT时代即将到来之际，开发先进技术分离行星信号至关重要。

Abstract: Context. Hot Jupiters are ideal natural laboratories to investigate atmospheric composition and dynamics. However, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy is currently limited by our capability of removing planet-occulted line-distortion (POLD) contamination from the signal. Aims. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transmission spectrum of WASP-31 b from two and a half transits observed with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT. Methods. The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signature was analyzed using the RM "revolutions" method. Before extracting the transmission spectrum of the planet, we corrected the dataset for telluric lines using molecfit and further modeled the POLD deformations using EvE. Results. We confirm the planet low sky-projected spin-orbit angle from previous studies and further refine its value to $λ= -0.09^{+0.31}_{-0.32}$ deg. We do not detect any species (including previously detected species such as K or CrH) in the planetary atmosphere. In most cases the non-detections are due to the strong POLDs contamination or lack of observable lines in the ESPRESSO wavelength range, and so previous detections cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. Planet-occulted line-distortion contamination continues to be the main limitation of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for species present in both the star and the planet, hindering atmospheric detections even with state-of-the-art models, in particular for planets with a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle. Developing advanced techniques to isolate planetary signatures is of utmost importance in the advent of ELT-like observations.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了系外行星大气挥发物损失问题，特别关注围绕M型和K型矮星运行的类地行星，这些行星因距离恒星更近而承受更强的X射线和紫外线辐射，可能影响其大气层稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于系外行星大气挥发物损失及其对宜居表面条件持久性影响的争论激烈。大多数已知的宜居带类地系外行星围绕低质量M型和K型矮星运行，这些行星的环境条件与太阳系类地行星截然不同，需要深入研究其大气稳定性。

Method: 通过分析太阳系类地行星上层大气中的挥发物损失机制，并将这些知识应用于不同类型恒星周围系外行星系统的研究。

Result: 研究指出M型和K型矮星周围的类地行星面临更强的X射线和紫外线辐射，可能导致大气剥离，但同时也承认系外行星的挥发物储量存在很大不确定性。

Conclusion: 需要进一步探索系外行星大气损失机制，特别是针对不同类型恒星周围行星的大气稳定性评估，这对于理解系外行星的长期宜居性至关重要。

Abstract: Volatile loss from exoplanetary atmospheres and its possible implications for the longevity of habitable surface conditions is a topic of vigorous debate currently. The vast majority of the habitable zone terrestrial-like exoplanets known to date orbit low-mass M- and K-dwarf stars and are subject to the conditions drastically different to those of terrestrial planets in the Solar System. In particular, they orbit far closer to their host stars than similar planets around G-dwarfs similar to the Sun. Therefore they receive higher X-ray and UV fluxes, even though luminosities of M- and K-dwarfs are lower than those of heavier stars. Furthermore, due to their slower evolution, M-dwarfs retain high activity on the gigayear timescales. The combination of these two effects has led to claims that most terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs may have their atmospheres stripped from the higher X-ray and UV fluxes of their host stars. Opposing this are researchers who point out that volatile inventories for terrestrial exoplanets are ill-constrained, and hence, they may be able to "weather the storm" of these higher X-ray and UV fluxes. In this chapter, we focus on exploring volatile loss in the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets in our solar system and applications to those in exoplanetary systems around stars of different types.

TL;DR: 日本首个火星探测器"希望号"搭载的MDC尘埃计数器在1998-2002年间探测到96个尘埃粒子，数据与Ulysses探测器在相同区域的结果一致，主要来自行星际尘埃而非地球轨道尘埃或太空碎片。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究日本首个火星探测器"希望号"搭载的MDC尘埃计数器在行星际空间和地球轨道收集的尘埃数据，验证行星际尘埃模型，为未来太空任务提供参考。

Method: 使用MDC尘埃计数器测量尘埃粒子的撞击速度和质量，与Ulysses探测器的数据进行对比分析，验证IMEM模型预测，并分析尘埃来源和分布特征。

Result: MDC探测到96个尘埃粒子，其速度和质量与Ulysses数据一致；地球轨道未发现地球束缚尘埃或太空碎片；尘埃撞击率变化符合IMEM模型预测；尘埃主要来自黄道面行星际尘埃；未明确识别彗星轨迹尘埃。

Conclusion: "希望号"的尘埃数据验证了行星际尘埃模型，表明探测器主要测量到行星际尘埃而非地球轨道物质，这些数据对未来MMX和DESTINY+等任务具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: Nozomi was Japan's first space mission to Mars, launched on 3 July 1998 UT. It was equipped with the Mars Dust Counter (MDC) which was an impact ionisation dust detector. MDC detected 96 dust particle impacts when the spacecraft was in Earth orbit and later in interplanetary space, before its operation ended in April 2002 due to a technical failure on board. We compare the Nozomi dust measurements with the dust measurements obtained with the dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Impact speeds and masses of dust particles measured by Nozomi MDC are overall consistent with the measurements obtained by Ulysses in the same region of interplanetary space. Based on the impact speeds measured while Nozomi was in Earth orbit, MDC detected neither dust particles of natural origin that were bound to the Earth nor space debris. The dust impact rate measured in interplanetary space varied by approximately a factor of 2, consistent with theoretical predictions by the Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model. The particle impact direction was concentrated towards the ecliptic plane, in agreement with an interplanetary origin of the majority of the measured dust particles. No impacts of cometary trail particles could positively be identified during known cometary trail crossings of Nozomi. The Nozomi dust data may become a valuable reference for the dust measurements to be obtained in the same region of interplanetary space with future space missions like, for example, MMX and DESTINY$^+$.
