Accepted to MNRAS", "summary": "Sub-Neptune planets, with no analogue in our solar system, provide a wealth of information about exoplanet diversity, formation & evolution, and habitability. Their robust characterisation requires the coupling of physically informed atmosphere and interior models with precise atmospheric data to break compositional degeneracies. Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-270 d revealed detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in its H$_2$-rich atmosphere, with tentative inferences of H$_2$O and CS$_2$ and a non-detection of NH$_3$. We conduct a theoretical exploration of the range of possible interiors for TOI-270 d based on the current observational constraints. We carry out internal structure modelling using a coupled atmosphere-interior model, including self-consistent atmospheric temperature structures informed by JWST observations. The bulk properties permit solutions spanning mini-Neptune, gas dwarf and hycean scenarios, with a wide range of possible surface conditions, which are strongly dependent on the atmospheric properties, including the presence of clouds/hazes. We explore the solutions allowing for surface water oceans on TOI-270 d, including under potentially habitable conditions. The atmospheric mass fractions permitting habitable surface conditions are found to be $\\lesssim$$3.5\\times10^{-5}$ and pressures $\\lesssim$100 bar for the envelope temperature structures considered. We consider mini-Neptune interiors that are sufficiently warm for H$_2$O to be mixed with the H$_2$-rich envelope. Finally, we consider possible gas dwarf interiors, finding H$_2$-rich envelope mass fractions of $\\sim$$1-5$ % are required to satisfy the bulk properties, with surface pressures $\\sim10^4-10^5$ bar. Further theoretical and experimental studies in addition to future atmospheric observations will aid the characterisation of the possible interior and surface conditions on TOI-270 d."}

In particular, the region where water freezes-out, the water snowline, could be a favorable location to form planets in protoplanetary disks. We use high resolution ALMA observations to spatially resolve H$_2$O, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and SO emission in the HL Tau disk. A rotational diagram analysis is used to characterize the water reservoir seen with ALMA and compare this to the reservoir visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths. We find that the H$_2$O 183 GHz line has a compact central component and a diffuse component that is seen out to ~75 au. A radially resolved rotational diagram shows that the excitation temperature of the water is ~350 K independent of radius. The steep drop in the water brightness temperature outside the central beam of the observations where the emission is optically thick is consistent with the water snowline being located inside the central beam ($\\lesssim 6$ au) at the height probed by the observations. Comparing the ALMA lines to those seen at shorter wavelengths shows that only 0.02%-2% of the water reservoir is visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths, respectively, due to optically thick dust hiding the emission whereas 35-70% is visible with ALMA. An anti-correlation between the H$_2$O and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission is found but this is likely caused by optically thick dust hiding the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission in the disk center. Finally, we see SO emission tracing the disk and for the first time in SO a molecular outflow and the infalling streamer out to ~2\". The velocity structure hints at a possible connection between the SO and the H$_2$O emission. Spatially resolved observations of H$_2$O lines at (sub-)mm wavelengths provide valuable constraints on the location of the water snowline, while probing the bulk of the gas-phase reservoirs."}

Alam"], "title": "A Comprehensive Analysis of the Panchromatic Transmission Spectrum of the Hot-Saturn WASP-96 b: Nondetection of Haze, Possible Sodium Limb Asymmetry, Stellar Characterization, and Formation History", "comment": "27 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables. accepted to AJ", "summary": "We conduct a reanalysis of the JWST NIRISS/SOSS observation of the hot-Saturn WASP-96 b. Initial analysis of this data revealed an enhanced Rayleigh scattering slope at the blue end of the transmission spectrum, suggesting the presence of hazes at high altitudes. In this work, we report non-detection of this slope, confirming an atmosphere clear of high-altitude aerosols consistent with the pre-JWST results. Also contrary to the initial result, our results indicate the presence of gray cloud deck, although at relatively low altitudes/high pressures. We further combined the NIRISS/SOSS spectrum with VLT, HST, and Spitzer to produce a transmission spectrum from 0.35 $μ$m to 5 $μ$m. We constrain the mass fraction of multiple chemical species, including: H$_2$O$=-2.62^{+0.43}_{-0.42}$, K$=-5.76^{+1.05}_{-1.13}$, and Na$=-3.40^{+0.90}_{-0.92}$. C/O ratio and metallicity are tentatively constrained at substellar values (C/O$_{planet}=0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ and [Fe/H]$_{planet}=0.01^{+0.46}_{-0.52}$ compared to C/O$_{star}=0.92\\pm0.25$ and [Fe/H]$_{star}=0.24\\pm0.05$). Inputing these composition constraints to interior models, we constrain a core mass of $43^{+8}_{-15}$ M$_\\oplus$. This, in addition to our inferred super-stellar refractory-to-oxygen ratio ($Δ\\log_{10}(R/O)=1.48^{+0.57}_{-0.62}$) and substellar C/O ratio, suggests that the core of WASP-96 b likely formed outside of water iceline, underwent disk-driven migration, and accreted its atmosphere inside the carbon soot line. We find evidence of atmospheric leading-trailing terminator asymmetries in the broadened sodium absorption feature with a transit time offset of 50 seconds, while the water features appear symmetric. CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$ remain unconstrained due to spectral coverage limits. Upcoming JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations (ID 4082, PI: M. Radica) will be crucial for constraining these carbon-bearing species."}

Lee"], "title": "Constructing Earth Formation History Using Deep Mantle Noble Gas Reservoirs", "comment": "27 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Submitted to the Planetary Science Journal (PSJ)", "summary": "Noble gases are powerful probes of the Earth's early history, as they are chemically inert. Neon isotopic ratios in deep mantle plumes suggest that nebular gases were incorporated into the Earth's interior. This evidence implies the Earth's formation began when there was still gas around, with Earth embryos accreting primordial gas and a fraction of that gas dissolved into molten magma. In this work, we examine these implications, simulating the growth of primordial envelopes using modern gas accretion schemes, and computing the dissolution of nebular Ne into magma oceans following chemical equilibrium. We find that the embryo mass that reproduces the deep mantle concentration of primordial Ne is tightly constrained to $\\sim 0.3 M_\\oplus$, within a solar nebula depleted by $\\geq 100 \\times$ in gas density. Embryos of smaller masses cannot accrete enough gas to allow the mantle to reach the melting temperature of basalt. Embryos of larger masses accrete way too much gas, producing excessive Ne concentrations in the deep mantle. Based on our calculations, we suggest that the Earth's formation began with the assembly of $\\sim 0.3 M_\\oplus$ embryos during the dispersal of the solar nebula. Light noble gases (He, Ne) in the deep mantle reflect the primordial gas accretion history of the Earth, while heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) probe early solid accretion processes. Our results are consistent with the final assembly of the Earth through at least two giant impacts after the dispersal of the nebula."}
