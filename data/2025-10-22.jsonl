In close binary star systems, however, the companion star's\ngravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable\n\\citep[]{Holman1999}, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form.\nNevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393\nbinary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify\n19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their\nmetallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population,\nmaking a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their\nformation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be\nresolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the\nprotoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that\nfacilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully\npredict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties.\nMoreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be\nevolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting\nthe model and pointing to these being second-generation planets. Our results\nhave therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes\nand provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the\nrole of trap-dusts in their formation."}

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Many white dwarfs have accreted material from their own planetary systems.\nThese objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and\nidentify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf\natmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the\ntrue composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted\nmetals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various\nphysical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on\nthe effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline\nmixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated\natmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete\ntreatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in\naccreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including\nthermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems,\nthe effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the\noverall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available\ngrids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a\nlarge impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the\ninferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems\nfor which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We\nalso present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential\nimpact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling."}

The drivers of the L/T transition remain elusive, with atmospheric\ncirculations and/or clouds usually suggested as potential mechanisms. Using a\nthree-dimensional Global Climate Model including cloud formation, transport and\nmulti-wavelength radiative effects, we show that clouds play a major role in\nshaping the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs. Cloud radiative effect,\nwhich triggers atmospheric convection, leads to spectral, spatial, and temporal\nvariability in the modelled brown dwarfs, in agreement with the observed\nvariability and L/T transition. Low latitudes are subject to sustained wave\nactivity, whereas eddies dominate higher latitudes.

We present an independent reanalysis of the original JWST\ntransmission spectrum of K2-18 b, to assess the robustness of previously\nclaimed detections, explore the parameter space, and implications for its\nformation. The observations were reduced using a combination of public and\ncustomized pipelines producing a total of 12 different versions of the\ntransmission spectrum by varying: spectral binning, limb-darkening, and a novel\ncorrection for the occulted stellar spot. We then performed atmospheric\nretrievals using TauREx 3, comparing models of varying complexity, robustly\ndetecting CH$_4$ (3-4$\\sigma$) across all configurations. The evidence for\nCO$_2$ is weaker and highly model-dependent. The tentative detection of\ndimethyl sulphide (DMS) vanishes in our most comprehensive retrieval models. We\nfind that correcting the stellar spot in the NIRISS transit is a critical step,\nintroducing a uniform offset that primarily drives the inference of a lower\nmean molecular weight atmosphere. Furthermore, the assumed complexity of the\nretrieval model itself introduces significant biases; including more molecules\nsystematically increases the retrieved CH$_4$ abundance and atmospheric mean\nmolecular weight, even for species without spectral features. The data are\nconsistent with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with an elevated O and an even more\nelevated C abundance, leading to a super-solar C/O. We show that the physical\nproperties of the system planets K2-18 c, and K2-18 b are consistent with those\nexpected by the in situ formation theory of Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF),\ninterior to the carbon \"soot\" line, where an elevated C/O ratio of a primordial\natmosphere is expected to be inherited from the protoplanetary disk."}

Subsequent observations with the Keck and Gemini South\nobservatories showed a reduction in the anti-tail and the growth of a\nconventional tail in a direction away from the sun. In this study we explain\nthe physics behind this evolution. As a function of heliocentric distance, we\nmodel the apparent visual brightness of scattering in the ice coma. As the\ncomet approaches the Sun, the exponential temperature dependence of the\nsublimation rate causes a continuous increase in the production rate of ice\ngrains and a sharp decline in their residence time within the observing\naperture. The combined effects produce a peak in total scattering cross-section\ndue to H$_2$O ice grains at 3-4 AU.

Accepted by A&A", "summary": "Planetary migration is a crucial stage in the early solar system, explaining\nmany observational phenomena and providing constraints on details related to\nthe solar system's origins. This paper aims to investigate the acceleration\nduring planetary migration in detail using numerical simulations, delving\ndeeper into the early solar system's preserved information. We confirm that\nplanetary migration is a positive feedback process: the faster the migration,\nthe more efficient the consumption of planetesimals; once the migration slows\ndown, Neptune clears the surrounding space, making further migration more\ndifficult to sustain. Quantitatively, a tenfold increase in migration rate\ncorresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in the mass of planetesimals\nconsumed to increase per unit angular momentum of Neptune. We also find that\nNeptune's final position is correlated with the initial surface density of\nplanetesimals at that location, suggesting that the disk density at 30au was\napproximately 0.009$M_{\\oplus}/au^2$ in the early solar system. Two mechanisms\nthat can accelerate planetary migration are identified: the first is MMR\nbetween Uranus and Neptune. Migration acceleration will be triggered whenever\nthese two giant planets cross their major MMR. The second mechanism is the ring\nstructure within the planetesimal disk, as the higher planetesimal density in\nthis region can provide the material support necessary for migration\nacceleration. Our research indicates that Neptune in the current solar system\noccupies a relatively delicate position. In case Neptune crossed the 1:2 MMR\nwith Uranus, it could have migrated to a much more distant location. Therefore,\nunder the influence of the positive feedback mechanism, the evolution of the\nsolar system to its current configuration might be a stochastic outcome rather\nthan an inevitable consequence."}

Classic pebble drift models treat volatile species individually as\nsublimating at their respective snowlines, although observations from the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that ices are likely mixed; laboratory\nstudies suggest ice mixtures can exhibit more complex sublimation behaviours,\nremaining trapped beyond their nominal sublimation temperatures. We present the\nfirst model that couples pebble growth and drift with CO entrapment inside\nwater ice - preventing a fraction (up to ~60%) of the CO from sublimating at\nits snowline, instead desorbing via volcanic desorption at the water\ncrystallisation front, at 130K. Our models show that CO entrapment will\nsignificantly impact the carbon and oxygen distributions, enhancing the\ngas-phase C/O and C/H inside the water snowline by up to a factor of 10 over 1\nMyr and a factor of a few around the CO2 snowline; O/H is also increased around\nthe CO2 snowline, but is water-dominated in the inner disc. Entrapment\ntherefore provides a means of introducing more carbon to the inner disc whilst\nretaining a large amount of water. We discuss connections to planet formation,\nnoting that CO entrapment can increase the gas-phase heavy element content\naround the water snowline by up to 150%.
