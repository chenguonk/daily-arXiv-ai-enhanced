This bias makes it difficult to infer the true circumbinary planet population, highlighting the need for alternative detection methods that do not rely on transits. In this work, we explore one such approach by leveraging apsidal precession as a dynamical signature of planetary companions. We analyse TESS photometry of a sample of 1,590 eclipsing binaries from the Gaia DR3 Catalogue of Eclipsing Binary Candidates to identify systems exhibiting detectable apsidal precession. We rule general relativistic, tidal, and rotational contributions as insufficient to account for the measured apsidal precession, demonstrating that an additional gravitational perturber is required. This enables us to constrain the possible masses and orbital separations of a companion that would cause the observed precession. We present a new set of 27 candidate circumbinary planets identified through this precession-based method as well as 6 candidate companions with a higher minimum mass. Their inferred properties remain degenerate, as the same dynamical signatures can arise from lower-mass planets at less than 1 AU or from more massive companions on wider, few-AU orbits, reflecting the current uncertainty in characterising these systems. Radial velocities can help break this degeneracy and provide direct confirmation."}

Pebble drift, coupled with volatile evaporation, has been proposed as a possible remedy to this with the level of heavy element enrichment a planet can accrete, as well as its atmospheric composition, being strongly dependent on where in the disc it is forming. We use a planet formation model which simulates the evolution of the protoplanetary disc, accounting for pebble growth, drift and evaporation, and the formation of planets from pebble and gas accretion. The growth and migration of planetary embryos is simulated in 10 different protoplanetary discs which have their chemical compositions matched to the host stars of the planets which we aim to reproduce, providing a more realistic model of their growth than previous studies. The heavy element content of giant exoplanets is used to infer their formation location and thus make a prediction of their atmospheric abundances. We focus here on giants more massive than Saturn, as we expect that their heavy element content is dominated by their envelope rather than their core. The heavy element content of 9 out of the 10 planets simulated is successfully matched to their observed values. Our simulations predict formation in the inner disc regions, where the majority of the volatiles have already evaporated and can thus be accreted onto the planet via the gas. As the majority of the planetary heavy element content originates from water vapour accretion, our simulations predict a high atmospheric O/H ratio in combination with a low atmospheric C/O ratio, in general agreement with observations. For certain planets, namely WASP-84b, these properties may be observable in the near future, offering a method of testing the constraints made on the planet's formation."}

Accepted for publication in the Earth, Planets and Space", "summary": "Icy planetesimals are likely to supply volatiles to terrestrial planets and serve as building blocks of icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Samples from the C-type asteroid Ryugu, collected by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, indicate a low-temperature history with aqueous alteration and organic materials. In contrast, iron meteorites with isotopic ratios similar to carbonaceous chondrites suggest exposure to higher temperatures. These findings imply that the thermal evolution of icy planetesimals is highly diverse. Since direct exploration provides only localized data, understanding this diversity requires comparing observational results with model calculations incorporating key evolutionary processes. We develop a model including radial growth, impact heating, water phase changes, aqueous alteration, and structural differentiation, to re-evaluate the thermal evolution of icy planetesimals during the first 100 Myr after CAI formation. The model considers final radius (10-1000 km), growth onset (1.0 or 2.0 Myr after CAI), growth duration (0.4 or 4.0 Myr), and growth mode (linear or runaway). Our results show that larger planetesimals generally reach higher temperatures, but growth timing and mode significantly affect thermal evolution. Early accretion leads to higher temperatures, with some bodies reaching the Fe-FeS eutectic (1250 K), while delayed or prolonged growth reduces heating. Our results show that the constituent materials of Ryugu, which kept below 40 degC, likely formed near the surface of a hydrated mineral layer. This is possible even in planetesimals several hundred kilometers in size due to efficient heat transport via convection. If accretion begins 2.0 Myr after CAI and completes in 0.4 Myr, a wide region in such a body could yield Ryugu's material."}

Kaib"], "title": "Was the Solar System's dynamical instability triggered by a (sub)stellar flyby?", "comment": "Icarus, in press", "summary": "An instability among the giant planets' orbits can match many aspects of the Solar System's current orbital architecture. We explore the possibility that this dynamical instability was triggered by the close passage of a star or substellar object during the Sun's embedded cluster phase. We run N-body simulations starting with the giant planets in a resonant chain and an outer planetesimal disk, with a wide-enough planet-disk separation to preserve the planets' orbital stability for $>$100 Myr. We subject the system to a single flyby, testing a wide range in flyby mass, velocity and closest approach distance. We find a variety of outcomes, from flybys that over-excite the system (or strip the planets entirely) to flybys too weak to perturb the planets at all. An intermediate range of flybys triggers a dynamical instability that matches the present-day Solar System. Successful simulations -- that match the giant planets' orbits without over-exciting the cold classical Kuiper belt -- are characterized by the flyby of a substellar object ($3-30 M_{Jup}$) passing within 20 au of the Sun. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Sun's birth cluster phase, parameterized by the product of the stellar density $η$ and the cluster lifetime $T$. The balance between under- and over-excitation of the young Solar System is at $ηT \\approx 5 \\times 10^4$~Myr pc$^{-3}$, in a range consistent with previous work. We find a probability of $\\sim$1% that the Solar System's dynamical instability was triggered by a substellar flyby. The probability increases to $\\sim$5% if the occurrence rate of free-floating planets and low-mass brown dwarfs is modestly higher than predicted by standard stellar initial mass functions."}

We have collected all the NEOWISE observations of 2001 CC21 from Nov 2021 through Feb 2024, a total of 132 frames, and analyzed this data to estimate an infrared radiometric diameter. We analyze the multi-epoch 3.4 and 4.6 micron NEOWISE data using an ellipsoidal rotating, cratered ThermoPhysical Model (TPM) to obtain estimates for the diameter, rotation pole, shape, and thermal inertia. 2001 CC21 is quite faint at 4.6 microns when Delta is about 0.7 AU, so the resulting diameter is substantially smaller than the 700 meters derived from the H magnitude and L spectral type. Recent polarimetric data has also suggested a smaller diameter, but not quite as small as the diameter derived from the thermal IR data. A fit to an ellipsoidal TPM model gives a volume equivalent sphere diameter of 337-27+33 meters [posterior median and central 68% confidence interval]. Prograde rotation with an obliquity of 24-9+6 deg is preferred. We also applied this TPM to the Spitzer data presented by Fornasier etal. (2024) and obtain a diameter of 476 +/- 9% meters which is consistent with the NEATM modeling presented by Fornasier etal. but with more realistic errorbars. Finally, fitting the NEOWISE and Spitzer data together requires unexpectedly large thermal inertias and gives a bimodal posterior diameter distribution."}

Therefore, transiting brown dwarfs are a testbed for the interior and evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. We have developed atmospheric and evolutionary models for this emerging population. We show that intense stellar irradiation can cause a large enhancement in the radius of transiting brown dwarfs at all masses, especially if the incident flux exceeds $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$9 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 1450$ K). Stellar irradiation can significantly alter rates of nuclear burning in irradiated brown dwarfs, making the Deuterium-burning and Hydrogen-burning minimum masses strong functions of incident stellar flux. We show that the D-burning and H-burning minimum masses can decrease by 16% and 13%, respectively, between isolated and strongly irradiated brown dwarfs ( $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$10 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 2570$ K)). This shows that stellar irradiation has a larger impact on the planet-brown dwarf-star mass boundaries than metallicity or clouds. We show that metal cores or migration affect their evolution to a much lesser extent, whereas low mass highly irradiated old sources can help us test the physics of hot Jupiter radius anomaly. We fit the observed radii of 46 transiting brown dwarfs and show that our irradiated evolutionary models fit their radii better than models that ignore the host star, especially for highly irradiated objects. However, the measured radii of 10 objects are still inconsistent at $>3σ$ level, indicating residual gaps in our irradiated evolutionary model."}

However, an evolving circumterrestrial environment may limit their applicability, particularly when models are trained on outdated debris representations. In this work, we devise a computational pipeline using synthetic fragmentation data from explosive breakup events, generated via a Standard Breakup Model and propagated under a high-fidelity dynamical model. Proper elements are extracted using adapted algorithms for modified equinoctial (MEE), Poincar'e (PNC), and quaternion (QTN) sets.\n  Extending beyond previous approaches limited to MEE space, we include PNC and QTN sets to broaden the dynamical fingerprints available to the classifier. Neural networks trained on various element combinations are used to determine if fragment pairs share a parent. Crucially, we identify a fundamental limitation when applying standard quaternion sets to neural networks: the loss of orbital size information during feature normalization. We introduce an augmented representation (QTN$_p$) that explicitly restores the semi-latus rectum, improving accuracy from 0.31 to 0.60 compared to the standard set. In synthetic Starlink-like LEO experiments, expanding proper-element sets generally improves discrimination. The best model, using a joint feature set (MEE + PNC + QTN), achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.858 compared to 0.789 for the MEE-only baseline, alongside higher accuracy and F1 scores."}

One consequence of this proximity is the expectation of spin synchronization, with implications for atmospheric circulation. Several mechanisms can maintain non-zero obliquities over long timescales in compact multi-planet systems, including capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) and other forms of secular spin-orbit coupling; such pathways are plausible in the orbital architectures of close-in M-dwarf planets. In this study, we search for transit duration variations (TDVs) consistent with the nodal precession rates predicted by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory in compact M-dwarf multi-planet systems. Our sample includes 23 exoplanets orbiting 12 stars. We compare recent, high-precision transit durations obtained from JWST white-light curves with measurements published at the discovery epoch and afterward. The resulting transit duration variation ranges from seconds to minutes, and we fit a linear trend to duration versus time for each planet. All systems are consistent with flat (no TDV) at the 3σ level. The strongest candidate is TRAPPIST-1d, whose fitted slope differs from zero with 2.2σ confidence. We calculate the expected TDV signals predicted by secular precession and compare them to the observed limits. Our null detection is consistent with the low-impact-parameter regime, where theoretical TDVs are only a few seconds per decade and below our sensitivity. Higher-impact-parameter configurations predict substantially larger TDVs and are disfavored: under uniformly distributed geometries, at least half of the allowed configurations would be excluded."}

In this first paper, we focus on Proxima Centauri, leveraging archival and recent HST observations in point-source imaging mode. We refine the geometric-distortion calibration of the HST detector used, and develop a robust methodology to derive high-precision astrometric parameters by combining HST measurements with the Gaia DR3 catalog. We determine Proxima's position, proper motion, and parallax with uncertainties at the $\\sim$0.4-mas, 50-$μ$as yr$^{-1}$, and 0.2-mas level, respectively, achieving consistent results with what measured by Gaia within $\\sim$1$σ$. We further investigate the presence of the candidate exoplanet Proxima c by analyzing the proper-motion anomaly derived from combining long-term HST-based and short-term Gaia astrometry. Under the assumption of a circular, face-on orbit, we obtain an estimated mass of $m_c = 3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4}$ $M_\\odot$, broadly consistent with radial-velocity constraints but limited by our current uncertainties. These results establish the foundation for the next phase of ARES, which will exploit HST spatial-scanning observations to achieve astrometric precisions of a few tens of $μ$as and enable a direct search for astrometric signatures of low-mass companions."}

Accepted for publication in Icarus", "summary": "During their formative stages, giant planets are fed by infalling material sourced from the background circumstellar disk. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the incoming gas and dust collects into a circumplanetary disk that processes the material before it reaches the central planet itself. This work investigates the complex vertical structure of these circumplanetary disks and calculates their radiative signatures. A self-consistent numerical model of the temperature and density structure of the circumplanetary environment reveals that circumplanetary disks are thick and hot, with aspect ratios $H/R\\sim0.1-0.25$ and temperatures approaching that of the central planet. The disk geometry has a significant impact on the radiative signatures, allowing future observations to determine critical system parameters. The resulting disks are gravitationally stable and viscosity is sufficient to drive the necessary disk accretion. However, sufficiently rapid mass accretion can trigger a thermal instability, which sets an upper limit on the mass accretion rate. This paper shows how the radiative signatures depend on the properties of the planetary system and discuss how the system parameters can be constrained by future observations."}

Submitted to AAS Journals - comments welcome!", "summary": "The unexpectedly large radii of transiting hot Jupiters have led to many proposals for the physical mechanisms responsible for heating their interiors. While it has been shown that hot Jupiters reinflate as their host stars brighten due to heating deep in planetary interiors, young hot Jupiters also exhibit signs of delayed cooling possibly related to heating closer to their surfaces. To investigate this tension, we enhance our previously published hot Jupiter thermal evolution model by adding a parameter that allows for both deep heating and delayed cooling. We fit our thermal evolution models to a homogeneous, physically self-consistent catalog of accurate and precise hot Jupiter system properties in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We find that hot Jupiters' interior cooling rates are reduced on average by 95\\%--98\\% compared to simpler anomalous heating models. The most plausible explanation for this inference is substantial shallow heating just below their radiative--convective boundaries that enables reinflation with much less deep heating. Shallow heating by Ohmic dissipation and/or temperature advection are therefore important components of accurate models of hot Jupiter atmospheres, especially in circulation models. If hot Jupiters are inflated primarily by shallow heating as we propose, then we predict that their observed phase curve offsets should increase with temperature in the range $T_{\\text{eq}}~\\lesssim1500~\\text{K}$, peak in the range $1500~\\text{K}~\\lesssim~T_{\\text{eq}}~\\lesssim~1800~\\text{K}$, and decrease in the range $T_{\\text{eq}}~\\gtrsim~1800~\\text{K}$."}
