Recent research supports the\n``breaking-the-chains'' hypothesis, which proposes that compact systems\ntypically form in chains of mean-motion resonances (MMRs) but subsequently\nbreak out on a $\\sim 100$Myr timescale. We investigate a scenario for breaking\nthe chains through intermittent flybys of planetesimals originating from a\ndistant reservoir. Using $N$-body simulations and semi-analytical calculations,\nwe characterize the disruption of MMRs through these flybys. We find a\nplanetesimal reservoir of total mass $\\gtrsim 0.04 M_{\\oplus}$ is required to\ndisrupt MMR chains, depending on the mass distribution and the typical number\nof flybys executed by each planetesimal. We verify that systems disrupted in\nthis way are frequently unstable to close encounters within $\\sim 100$Myr of\nthe final flyby.

It was found that high\n(low) value for K correspond to outward (inward) migration. In this paper we\naim at understanding the mechanism driving inward/outward migration and why it\ncorrelates with the gap depth. We performed a suite of 2D, live-planet,\nlong-term simulations of massive planets migrating in discs with the hydro-code\nFargo3D. We focus on a range of planet masses (1-13 m_J) and disc aspect ratios\n(0.03-0.1) and analyze the evolution of orbital elements and gap structure. We\nalso study the torque contributions from outer Lindblad resonances to\ninvestigate their role in the migration outcome. We find that, while all\nplanets initially migrate inwards, those with high enough K eventually enter a\nphase in which the torque reverses sign and migration becomes outwards, until\neventually stalling. This behavior is associated with eccentricity growth in\nthe outer disc and changes in the gap structure. We identify the surface\ndensity ratio at the 1:2 and 1:3 outer Lindblad resonances as a key output\ndiagnostic that correlates with the migration direction. This ratio regulates\nthe migration for all the cases where the massive planet remains in an almost\ncircular orbit and the outer gap region exhibits moderate eccentricity. This\ncharacteristic sequence of inward-reversal-outwards-stalling occurs for a\nvariety of K values and thus further work is required to identify the\nsimulation input parameters that determine the onset of this sequence. Our\nresults suggest that outward migration in the planet-dominated regime is\nprimarily governed by the relative importance of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances\nand, therefore, the gap profile plays a crucial role in determining the\ndirection of migration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684II\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u884c\u661f\u95f4\u9699\u6df1\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570K\u76f8\u5173\uff1a\u9ad8K\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5411\u5916\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4f4eK\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5411\u5185\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5916Lindblad\u5171\u632f\u7684\u626d\u77e9\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b01:2\u548c1:3\u5171\u632f\u5904\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684II\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u5411\u5185/\u5411\u5916\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u95f4\u9699\u6df1\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570K\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Fargo3D\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c2D\u3001\u6d3b\u884c\u661f\u3001\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a761-13\u6728\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u5728\u76d8\u539a\u5ea6\u6bd40.03-0.1\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f68\u9053\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u95f4\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916Lindblad\u5171\u632f\u7684\u626d\u77e9\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u884c\u661f\u521d\u59cb\u90fd\u5411\u5185\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8K\u503c\u7684\u884c\u661f\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u8fdb\u5165\u626d\u77e9\u53cd\u8f6c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u53d8\u4e3a\u5411\u5916\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u505c\u6ede\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5916\u76d8\u504f\u5fc3\u589e\u957f\u548c\u95f4\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u30021:2\u548c1:3\u5916Lindblad\u5171\u632f\u5904\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u661f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u5916\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e3b\u8981\u75311:2\u548c1:3\u5171\u632f\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u95f4\u9699\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5728\u51b3\u5b9a\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "Radio observations provide a window into a planet's interior and play a\ncrucial role in studying its atmosphere and surface, key factors to find\npotential habitability. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, together with\nadvances in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), motivates\nthe search for planetary-scale radio emissions. Here, we employ the radiometric\nBode's law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330\nconfirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission.\nPermutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses\nindicate that a planet's mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance\nfrom Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency.\nThe random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics,\nconfirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering\nobservational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals\ndetectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA*\ndeployment. Among these, MASCARA-1 b stands out with a predicted flux of 7.209\nmJy at 135.1 MHz, making it an excellent SKA-Low target. Meanwhile, WASP-18 b,\nwith a flux of 18.638 mJy peaking at 812.9 MHz, is the most promising candidate\nfor SKA-Mid. These results show that the SKA can detect gas giants, such as\nMASCARA-1 b (SNR>400) and WASP-18 b (SNR>4236), within feasible integration\ntimes. Additionally, we identify four candidates (HATS-18 b, WASP-12 b,\nWASP-103 b, and WASP-121 b) that are likely affected by radio quenching,\nhighlighting the importance of considering this effect in target selection for\nobservation campaigns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u67901330\u9897\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b064\u9897\u884c\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u88abSKA\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dMASCARA-1 b\u548cWASP-18 b\u662f\u6700\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5343\u9897\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u9635\u5217(SKA)\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u53d1\u5c04\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u5c45\u4f4f\u884c\u661f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f90\u5c04\u8ba1\u6ce2\u5fb7\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u884c\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u957f\u8f74\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa64\u9897\u53ef\u88abSKA\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dMASCARA-1 b\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u91cf7.209 mJy(135.1 MHz)\uff0cWASP-18 b\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u91cf18.638 mJy(812.9 MHz)\uff0c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5206\u522b\u8d85\u8fc7400\u548c4236\u3002", "conclusion": "SKA\u80fd\u591f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u6c14\u6001\u5de8\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6dec\u706d\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}
