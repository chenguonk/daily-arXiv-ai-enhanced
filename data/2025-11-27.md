Result: 检测到甲醇和氰化氢，甲醇包含彗发来源（L_p>258 km），氰化氢来自核直接升华，甲醇/氰化氢比例高达124和79，仅次于异常彗星C/2016 R2。

Abstract: We report the detection of methanol (CH$_3$OH) toward interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Atacama Compact Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on UT 2025 August 28, September 18 and 22, and October 1, and of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on September 12 and 15. These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p>258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS).

Abstract: Studying cold brown dwarfs is key to understanding the diverse characteristics of cold giant exoplanets atmospheres. COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.

TL;DR: 行星吸积可以显著减弱向内迁移趋势，甚至改变迁移方向。中等质量行星表现出向外迁移趋势，这主要由吸积行星周围的方位角不对称结构产生的正扭矩驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的行星迁移理论（类型I和II）通常导致向内迁移，这与观测到的行星系统结构难以匹配。本研究旨在探索吸积行星的迁移行为，以解释行星系统的形成。

Method: 使用高分辨率3D/2D数值流体动力学模拟，在不同盘条件下比较不同质量比行星的动力学演化。

Result: 发现吸积可以显著减弱向内迁移趋势，中等质量行星（质量比约1×10⁻⁴到4×10⁻³）表现出向外迁移。向外迁移主要由吸积行星周围的方位角不对称结构产生的正扭矩驱动。

Conclusion: 行星质量增长的终止与从向外迁移到向内迁移的转变同步。简单的间隙开启参数可以确定向外迁移条件，为理解行星系统形成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Migration typically occurs during the formation of planets and is closely linked to the planetary formation process. In classical theories of non-accreting planetary migration, both type I and type II migration typically result in inward migration, which is hard to align with the architecture of the planetary systems.In this work, we conduct systematic, high-resolution 3D/2D numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the migration of an accreting planet. Under different disk conditions, we compared the dynamical evolution of planets with different planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that accretion of planets can significantly diminish the inward migration tendency of planets, or even change the migration direction. The migration of low-/high-mass planets is classified as Type I/II inward migration, respectively, while intermediate-mass planets, which have the strongest accretion, show an outward migration trend. We confirm that the outward migration is mainly attributed to the positive torque from the azimuthal asymmetric structures around the accreting planet, similar to Li et al. (2024). The termination of planetary mass growth is thus synonymous with the transition from outward to inward migration. For the high viscosity $α=0.04$ and disk aspect ratio height $h_0=0.05$ cases, the mass ratio range for planetary outward migration is $1\times10^{-4}\lesssim q\lesssim4\times10^{-3}$. For the low viscosity case with $α=0.001$, and/or the low disk aspect ratio cases $h_0=0.03$, the mass ratio range for the outward migration will shift toward the lower end. Our parameter survey reveals that a simple gap opening parameter determines the outward migration condition; details of the analytical interpretation are presented in Ida et al. (2025).

Abstract: Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了系外行星大气的一维和三维模型光谱差异，并计算了JWST望远镜区分这些差异所需的观测时间，以HD 189733b为例展示了3D模型的重要性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着JWST望远镜的高精度观测能力，现在可以观测测试1D和3D大气模型之间的差异，这对于理解系外行星大气物理和化学过程至关重要。

Method: 使用HD 189733b作为案例研究，进行了三组模拟：1D大气模型配1D辐射传输，以及3D GCM模型配1D和3D辐射传输，结合平衡和非平衡化学，并使用JWST噪声模拟器计算信噪比。

Result: 发现3D模型通常显示较弱的光谱特征，透射光谱的信噪比为2.04-7.68（平衡）和1.66-7.04（非平衡），发射光谱为5.90-34.52（平衡）和7.11-36.93（非平衡）。

Conclusion: JWST能够区分1D和3D模型光谱的主要分子特征，强调了3D建模在解释系外行星大气中的重要性。

Abstract: Modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets is fundamental to understanding their atmospheric physics and chemical processes. While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres.
