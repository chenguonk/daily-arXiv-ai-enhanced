However, their impact on dust dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in the weakly coupled regime (St$\\gg$1). We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of parabolic stellar flybys-both coplanar and inclined-interacting with a gaseous and dusty protoplanetary disc. Dust species with Stokes numbers ranging from 15 to 100, corresponding to four grain sizes under a uniform initial gas surface density, are included. Perturber masses of 0.1 and 1$\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ are considered. The induced spiral structures exhibit distinct dynamical behaviours in gas and dust: dust spirals retain a nearly constant pattern speed, while gas spirals gradually decelerate. The pitch angles of both components decrease over time, with dust evolving more rapidly. In the weakly coupled regime, gas and dust spirals are spatially offset, facilitating dust accumulation around both structures. Equal-mass flybys truncate the disc at approximately $\\sim$0.55$r_{\\mathrm{Hill}}$, producing tightly wound, ring-like spirals that promote dust concentration. By mapping the streaming instability growth rates in the solid abundance-Stokes number space across three evolutionary phases, we find that a low-mass flyby suppresses dust concentration below the critical clumping threshold after periastron and maintains this suppression over time, indicating long-lasting inhibition of dust clumping. An equal-mass flyby raises local solid abundance well above the threshold, suggesting that such encounters may foster conditions favourable for dust clumping. Flyby-induced spirals play a central role in shaping dust evolution, leading to distinct spatial and temporal behaviours in weakly coupled discs."}

While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation."}

Previous work has revealed a bimodal distribution of asteroid spin rates, dividing populations into fast and slow rotators, but to date this separation remains poorly understood (e.g. its dependency on composition).\n  We investigate whether the valley separating fast and slow rotators in rotational period-diameter space depends on the composition of the asteroid, approximated by asteroids' spectral class.\n  First, we extended the Minor Planet Physical Properties Catalogue (MP3C) to include the available spectral classes of asteroids. Then, for each asteroid we selected the best diameter, rotational period, and spectral class. Building upon a semi-supervised machine-learning method, we quantify the valley between fast and slow rotators for S- and C-complex asteroids, which are linked to ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites respectively. The method iteratively fits a linear boundary between the two populations in rotational period-diameter space to maximise their separation.\n  We find a clear compositional dependence of the valley: for C-complex asteroids the transition occurs at longer periods than for S-complex, with P* = 14.4 D_km^0.739 (C-complex) and P* = 11.6 D_km^0.718 (S-complex), where period and diameter are given in hours and kilometres respectively. This corresponds to mu Q approximately 2 and 13 GPa, respectively, where mu is the rigidity and Q the quality factor.\n  The dependence of the valley on spectral classes likely reflects compositional and structural differences: C-complex asteroids, being more porous and weaker, dissipate angular momentum more efficiently than stronger, more coherent S-complex asteroids. This represents quantitative evidence of class-dependent rotational valleys within asteroid populations."}

We aim to study the planetesimal formation via the SI, driven by the stellar X-ray photoevaporation during the late stages of disk dispersal, and quantify its dependence on key disk and stellar parameters. We use the DustPy code to simulate the dust dynamics including coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift in a viscously accreting disk undergoing stellar X-ray photoevaporation. Stellar X-rays drive the disk dispersal, opening a cavity at a few au orbital distance and inducing the formation of an associated local pressure maximum. This pressure maximum acts as a trap for radially drifting dust, therefore enhancing the dust density to the critical level required to initiate the streaming instability and the subsequent collapse into planetesimals. The fiducial model produces 31.4 M_\\oplus of planetesimals with an initial dust to final planetesimal conversion efficiency of 20.4%. This pathway is most efficient in larger disks with higher metallicities, lower viscosities, higher dust fragmentation threshold velocities, and/or around stars with higher X-ray luminosities. This work demonstrates that stellar X-ray photoevaporation is a robust and feasible mechanism for triggering planetesimal formation via the SI during the final clearing phase of protoplanetary disk evolution."}

Jaziri", "Nathalie Carrasco", "Benjamin Charnay"], "title": "Possible favored Great Oxidation Event scenario on exoplanets around M-Stars with the example of TRAPPIST-1e", "comment": "Accepted in Nature Scientific Report", "summary": "The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which marked the transition from an anoxic to an oxygenated atmosphere, occurred 2.4 billion years ago on Earth, several hundreds of millions of years after the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis. This long delay implies that specific conditions in terms of biomass productivity and burial were necessary to trigger the GOE. It could be a limiting factor for the development of oxygenated atmospheres on inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we explore the specificities of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf for a GOE. Using a 1D coupled photochemical-climate model, we simulate the atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-like exoplanet, exploring the effect of oxygen sources (biotic or abiotic). Our results show that the stellar energy distribution promotes O3 production at lower O2 concentrations compared to Earth, and the ozone layer on TRAPPIST-1 e forms more efficiently. This lowers the threshold for atmospheric oxidation, suggesting that the GOE on TRAPPIST-1 e would occur quickly after the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis, up to 1Gyrs earlier than on Earth, and would reach O2 enabling oxygenic respiration and thus the development of animals. We may question whether this is a general behavior around several M-stars. Furthermore, we discuss how the overproduction of ozone could make O3 detection possible using the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a potential method to observe oxygenation signatures on exoplanets in the near future. Previous studies predicted that for an Earth-like atmosphere O3 would require over 150 transits for detection, but our results show that significantly fewer transits could be needed."}

In compact multiplanetary systems, secular spin-orbital resonance may preserve high obliquities and asynchronous rotation even for tidally-despinning, low-mass planets, potentially leading to unique atmospheric circulation patterns. To understand the impact on the atmospheric circulation and to identify the potential atmospheric observational signatures of such high-obliquity planets, we simulate the three dimensional circulation of a representative mini-Neptune K2-290 b, whose obliquity may reach about 67 degrees. Whether synchronously rotating or not, the planet's slow rotation, moderate temperature and radius result in a global Weak-Temperature-Gradient (WTG) behavior with moderate horizontal temperature contrasts. Under synchronous rotation, broad eastward superrotating jets efficiently redistribute heat. Circulation in an asynchronous rotation exhibits a seasonal cycle driven by high obliquity, along with quasi-periodic oscillations in winds and temperatures with a period of about 70 orbital periods. These oscillations, driven by wave-mean flow interactions, extend from low to mid-latitudes due to the slow planetary rotation. Higher atmospheric metallicity strengthens radiative forcing, increasing temperature contrasts and jet speeds. Clouds have minimal impact under synchronous rotation but weaken jets under nonsynchronous rotation by reducing temperature contrasts. In all cases, both thermal emission and transmission spectra exhibit moderate observational signals at a level of 100 ppm, and high-obliquity effects contribute differences at the 10 ppm level. Our results are also applicable to a range of potential high-obliquity exoplanets, which reside in the WTG regime and likely exhibit nearly homogeneous horizontal temperature patterns."}

Wogan", "Suvrath Mahadevan", "Sagnick Mukherjee"], "title": "The Role of Intrinsic Temperature and Vertical Mixing in Characterizing Sub-Neptune Atmospheres", "comment": "Submitted to AAS Journals (26 pages)", "summary": "Sub-Neptune planets are often modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich interior beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also be explained by a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. Atmospheric composition provides a key mechanism to break this degeneracy between competing interior models. However, the overall composition of sub-Neptunes inferred from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored parameter spaces such as stellar spectra, atmospheric metallicities, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet poorly constrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint (60 - 450 K) and Kzz (10^{5} - 10^{12} cm^2/s) using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN packages to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that Tint and Kzz significantly impact CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 and HCN abundances, with H2O being largely unaffected. Our work demonstrates that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra, and that single-parameter assumptions can lead to misclassification of planetary interiors. We provide a diagnostic framework using multi-molecule observations to distinguish between competing atmospheric models and advance robust characterization of sub-Neptunes."}

Like previous surveys, this one found a bimodal colour distribution in TNOs, categorised as red and very red. Additionally, this survey proposed an alternative surface classification scheme: FaintIR and BrightIR. Cold classical TNOs mostly have very red or FaintIR surfaces, while dynamically excited TNOs show a mixture of surfaces. This likely indicates that formation locations and proximity to the Sun influenced surface characteristics and color changes. Our study combines the data from Col-OSSOS with two dynamical models describing the formation of the Kuiper belt during Neptune's migration. We investigate the proposed surface-colour changing line and explore the distribution of different surfaces within the primordial disk. By comparing radial colour transitions across various scenarios, we explore the origins of surface characteristics and their implications within the context of BrightIR and FaintIR classifications. Moreover, we extend our analysis to examine the distribution of these surface classes within the present-day Kuiper Belt, providing insights into the configuration of the early solar system's planetesimal disk prior to giant planet migration. We find that the most likely primordial disk compositions are inner neutral / outer red (with transition $30.0^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au), or inner BrightIR / outer FaintIR (with transition $31.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au)."}
