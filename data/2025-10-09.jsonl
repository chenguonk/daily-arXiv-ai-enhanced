While such measurements\nprovide key information on ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is\nknown about their composition, grain size distribution, origin, lifetime, or\nevolutionary pathways. Here we report near-infrared observations from the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by the Centaur (10199)\nChariklo, providing unprecedented constraints on the material properties of a\nsmall-body ring system and offering insights into their origin and evolution.\nThese measurements reveal that Chariklo's inner dense ring contains\npredominantly micrometer-sized particles and exhibits a significant increase in\nopacity compared to previous observations, suggesting active replenishment\nevents. Most strikingly, the outer ring shows a much weaker near-infrared\noccultation signature than in earlier visible-light detections. This\ndiscrepancy may indicate ongoing material loss, implying that the outer ring is\ntransient, or it may reflect wavelength-dependent opacity consistent with a\ndusty structure dominated by $0.2$-$0.5$ $\\mu$m silicate grains.

To ensure homogeneity and precision, we modeled all 391\nlight curves and determined their mid-transit times. A detailed transit timing\nanalysis revealed a significant orbital decay rate of $-30.31 \\, \\mathrm{ms \\,\nyr^{-1}}$, corresponding to a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q'_\\star = 1.61\n\\times 10^{5}$, thereby confirming that the orbit of WASP-12b is indeed\ndecaying rapidly. Furthermore, the computation of model selection metrics\n($\\chi^2_r$, BIC, AIC) favors orbital decay as the most likely explanation.\nHowever, the presence of an eccentricity above the threshold value allows\napsidal precession to remain a viable alternative. We also derived a planetary\nLove number of $k_p = 0.66 \\pm 0.28$, consistent with Jupiter's value,\nsuggesting a similar internal density distribution. Therefore, while orbital\ndecay is strongly supported, apsidal precession cannot be ruled out as another\ncontributing effect, highlighting the necessity of continued high-precision\nmonitoring to resolve the system's orbital evolution."}

Protoplanetary discs are the birthplaces of planets. Recent studies\nhighlight the role of stellar mass sampling in determining disc lifetimes from\nthe observed fraction of stars with discs. Low-mass stars tend to host\nlonger-lived discs, allowing planet formation via solid accretion. Observations\nalso reveal a strong correlation between stellar (and substellar) mass and\naccretion rate, typically following $\\dot{M}\\propto M_\\star^2$. Aims. We aim to\nidentify the optimal parameters of a disc evolution model that reproduces both\nthe observed disc fractions and accretion rates in young stellar populations.\nMethods. We performed a population synthesis study exploring different\ndependencies of the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ on stellar mass. Disc\nevolution includes viscous accretion and photoevaporation (internal and\nexternal). Initial disc masses and radii were drawn from observationally\nmotivated distributions, while stellar masses followed a given distribution and\na time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) was introduced. Results. Matching\nobserved disc fractions and accretion trends requires $\\alpha$ to increase with\nstellar mass. External photoevaporation is necessary to produce low-mass discs\nwith high accretion rates, and a time-dependent SFR enhances accretion in young\nclusters while extending disc lifetimes in older ones. A stellar mass cut-off\nreproduces the distance-dependent biases in observed disc fractions.\nConclusions. Both stellar and environmental effects are essential to explain\nthe observed properties of protoplanetary discs. A stellar-mass-dependent\nviscosity reproduces the $\\dot{M}$-$M_\\star$ relation, while external\nphotoevaporation and extended star formation histories shape the accretion rate\ndistribution across environments."}

We aim to investigate the origin, stability, and\npotential role in Pluto's volatile cycle of these localized frost deposits.\n  Methods:We implemented a new sub-grid-scale slope parameterization in the\nPluto Volatile Transport Model, which accounts for the specific solar\nirradiation and resulting surface and subsurface temperatures on sloped\nterrains. This parameterization also allows the condensation and sublimation of\nvolatiles (either N2 or CH4) on slopes, including the effect of large-scale\ntransport of these species, which is key to determining the amount of frost\nthat forms or disappears.\n  Results: Our simulations reproduce the observed CH4 frost on North-facing\nslopes as seasonal deposits currently sublimating, predict perennial CH4 frost\non South-facing slopes, and show that slope microclimates should not alter\nglobal volatile cycles.\n  Conclusions: Seasonal and perennial N2 and CH4 frosts can form across Pluto's\nslopes, even in its darkest and warmest regions, due to the locally reduced\nsunlight received on inclined terrain.

Traditionally, periodograms are used to identify promising\ncandidate signals before further observational investment, but their\neffectiveness is often limited for low-amplitude signals due to stellar jitter.\nIn this work, we develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on a\nTransformer architecture that aims to detect the presence and likely period of\nplanetary signals in time-series spectra, even in the presence of stellar\nactivity. The model is trained to classify whether a planetary signal exists\nand assign it to one of several discrete period and amplitude bins.\nInjection-recovery tests on randomly selected 100 epoch observation subsets\nfrom NEID solar data (2020-2022 period) show that for low-amplitude systems\n($<$1 ms$^{-1}$), our model improves planetary candidate identification by a\nfactor of two compared to the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram.\n  Our ML model is built on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that\nprocesses reduced representations of solar spectrum observations to predict the\nperiod and semi-amplitude of planetary signal candidates. By analyzing\nmulti-epoch spectra, the model reliably detects planetary signals with\nsemi-amplitudes as low as 65 cms$^{-1}$. Even under real solar noise and\nirregular sampling, it identifies signals down to 35 cms$^{-1}$. Comparisons\nwith the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate a significant improvement in\ndetecting low-amplitude planetary candidates, particularly for longer orbital\nperiods.

This is because\nmodern observations can only detect objects up to centimetre sizes, whilst\nlarger planetesimals, which dominate disc mass, remain hidden. We must\ntherefore use other arguments, such as dynamics, to indirectly infer disc\nmasses and body sizes. This paper presents a new method, applicable to narrow\ndebris discs like Fomalhaut. We argue that such discs cannot be too massive,\nnor the largest bodies too large, otherwise they would self-scatter and the\ndisc would be much broader than observed. Using n-body dynamics and collisional\ntheory, we demonstrate that the mass of Fomalhaut's disc cannot be dominated by\nprimordial Plutos. Instead, if the mass is dominated by primordial bodies, then\nthey should have radii below $300^{+80}_{-70}$ km ($0.3 \\pm 0.1$ RPluto) and\nabove $5^{+20}_{-4}$ km. Such bodies would each have less than 1 per cent the\nmass of Pluto. Our conclusions are robust to additional physics, including\nshepherding planets and collisional damping. Our results provide independent,\ndynamical support for the idea that the masses of bright debris discs are\ndominated by objects smaller than Pluto."}

We conducted spectroscopic\nobservations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary\nmaterial around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's\natmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using\natmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns,\nthe SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect\nstrong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are\nobserved in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated\nC/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet,\ntracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than\nthe non-extended component.

In this work, we present a self-consistent comoving\nframework designed to overcome these challenges. Our method employs a\ncoordinate transformation that scales with the planet's evolving semi-major\naxis, keeping the planet stationary with respect to its local computational\ngrid. This transforms the standard hydrodynamic equations by introducing a\nsource term that accounts for the inertial forces of the non-inertial reference\nframe. We implement this framework in the FARGO3D code and validate it through\na benchmark test, demonstrating excellent agreement with conventional\nfixed-grid simulations until the latter are compromised by boundary effects.\nOur analysis shows that the comoving method can be over an order of magnitude\nmore computationally efficient, dramatically reducing the cost of simulating\nmigrating planets. Furthermore, the framework's adaptability enables efficient,\nhigh-resolution studies of planets on eccentric orbits by keeping them\nstationary within the computational grid. This framework serves as both a\npowerful numerical and theoretical tool, simplifying the time-dependent flow\naround a migrating planet that offers clearer physical insight.
