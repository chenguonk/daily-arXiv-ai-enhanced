The CHARA Array can resolve companions down to 0.5\nmilli-arcseconds, allowing us in principle to directly measure the\nnear-infrared spectra of non-transiting \"Hot Jupiter\" exoplanets. We present\ndata taken with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array on the Hot\nJupiter Upsilon Andromedae b. By resolving the star-planet system, we attempt\nto directly detect the flux from the planet. We describe our self-calibration\nmethods for modeling systematics in the closure phase data, which allows us to\nreach sub-degree precision. Through combining multiple nights of data across\ntwo MIRC-X runs in 2019 and 2021, we achieved a very tentative detection of Ups\nAnd b in the H-band at a planet/star contrast of 2-3 x 10^-4. Unfortunately, we\ncannot confirm this detection with 2021 MYSTIC data in the K-band, or in a 2023\njoint MIRC-X and MYSTIC dataset. We run updated global circulation models and\ncreate post-processed spectra for this planet, and report the resulting model\nspectra in H- and K-bands as a function of orbital phase. We then run planetary\ninjection tests to explore H/K-band contrast limits, and find that we can\nconfidently recover planets down to a planet/star contrast of 1-2 x 10^-4. We\nshow that we are probing contrasts fainter than predicted by the model, making\nour non-detection surprising. We discuss prospects for the future in using this\nmethod to characterize companions with interferometry."}

Today, the majority of these measurements are\nderived from Echelle spectra in the optical wavelength region using\ncross-correlation techniques. Although for certain stars these approaches can\nproduce RVs with sub-1 m~s$^{-1}$ measurement errors, for many others, we are\nnow in a regime where instrumental precision is fundamentally below the\nintrinsic RV variations of the star that result from astrophysical processes\nthat can be correlated in both time and wavelength. We explore new methods for\nmeasuring exoplanet orbital parameters that take advantage of the fact that RV\ndata sets are fundamentally multi-wavelength. By analyzing NEID extremely\nprecise radial velocity (EPRV) data of three known exoplanet systems, we show\nthat fitting a single Keplerian model to multi-wavelength RVs can produce a\nfactor of 1.5 -- 6.8 better $M_p \\sin i$ uncertainties compared to fitting RVs\nthat are derived from a weighted average across wavelength."}

In particular, the fraction of deuterated water, which is usually is\nmostly frozen in the midplane of a protoplanetary disc, has been measured for\nthe first time in the gas of the disc around a FUor V883 Ori. We test the\nhypothesis that the observed high HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio in the V883 Ori\nprotoplanetary disc can be explained by luminosity outbursts of different\namplitude, including a series of two consecutive outbursts. Using the ANDES\nastrochemical code, we modelled the distributions of water and deuterated water\nabundances under the action of luminosity outbursts of different amplitudes\n(from 400 to 10 000 $L_{\\odot}$) and at different stellar luminosities at the\npre-outburst stage. We show that the best agreement with the observed\nHDO/H$_{2}$O profile is obtained for outburst amplitudes of 2 000 and 10 000\n$L_{\\odot}$, while the observed bolometric luminosity of V883 Ori does not\nexceed 400 $L_{\\odot}$. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy,\nincluding the presence of past luminosity outbursts, the age of the star, and\nthe influence of additional heating mechanisms in the midplane of the\nprotoplanetary disc.

Submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome", "summary": "Stellar surface inhomogeneities such as spots and faculae introduce Doppler\nvariations that challenge exoplanet detection via the radial velocity method.\nWhile their impact on disc-integrated spectra is well established, detailed\nstudies of the underlying local line profiles have so far been limited to the\nSun. We present an observational campaign targeting the active star WASP-85 A\nduring transits of its hot Jupiter companion. The transits span two stellar\nrotation periods, allowing us to probe the evolution of active regions. From\nground-based photometry we identify seven active regions, six containing dark\nspots. Using simultaneous ESPRESSO transit spectroscopy, we spatially resolve\nthese regions on the stellar surface by using the planet as a probe. We detect\nsignificant bisector shape changes, line broadening, and net redshifts during\nspot occultations, with velocity shifts of 108-333 m/s (mean uncertainty 50\nm/s). The observed broadening is consistent with the Zeeman effect, implying\nmagnetic field strengths (Stokes $I$) $B$ = 2.7-4.4 kG (mean uncertainty 0.6\nkG), comparable to solar umbrae. Combined with our photometric spot model, this\nyields lower limits to the disc-integrated field $Bf = 16 \\pm 3$ G and $61 \\pm\n9$ G for the two hemispheres probed -- at least three times higher than\nSun-as-a-star values. We also measure centre-to-limb variations in FWHM, line\ndepth, equivalent width, and convective blueshift, which broadly agree with\nsolar observations and 3D MHD models. This work demonstrates a new way to\ncharacterise the surfaces of exoplanet host stars, paving the way for future\nanalyses incorporating synthetic line profiles from 3D MHD simulations."}

Compared to\ntraditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework,\nour approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to\nefficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs\nMCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the\norbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a\nsubstantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times\nfaster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested\nsampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average\nlog-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling\nefficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our\napproach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected\nfrom future exoplanet surveys.

Since the snow line in a protoplanetary\ndisc plays a crucial role in determining the amount of solid material available\nfor planet formation, we explore the icy regions of protoplanetary discs around\nstars with masses 0.1, 0.5 and 1 $\\rm M_\\odot$. In a protoplanetary disc, a\ndead zone, where the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is suppressed,\nprovides a quiescent region for solids to settle to the mid-plane and planets\nto form. Viscosity may be driven in the dead zone by gravitational instability\nif enough material builds up. Heating from the gravitational instability can\ntrigger the MRI and an accretion outburst onto the star. There may be two icy\nregions in a disc: (1) far from the star and (2) in the dead zone close to the\nstar. We solve the 1D disc equations to find steady state solutions and\ntime-dependent evolution with different values for the critical surface density\nin the MRI-active surface layers. Larger surface density in the MRI-active\nsurface layers reduces the extent and lifetime of the inner icy region. The\ninner icy region in the dead zone around a solar mass star is small and\nshort-lived. Around M-dwarfs, the size of the inner icy region is more\npersistent and oscillates between the accretion outbursts in the region 0.1-1\nau. An extended icy region within the dead zone of a disc around M-dwarfs may\npromote the formation of more numerous and massive close-in super-Earths."}

Accurate inference of planet formation using these elemental\nabundances require the corresponding abundance measurements for the host star.\nWe present the second set of results from our high-resolution spectroscopic\nsurvey of directly imaged companion host stars, measuring abundances of 16\nelements (including C, O, Na, Mg, Si, S, K and Fe) for five directly imaged\ncompanion host stars. Using both the spectral fitting and the equivalent width\nmethods, we find solar C/O ratios for HR 2562 (0.58 $\\pm$ 0.09), AB Pic (0.50\n$\\pm$ 0.14), and YSES 1 (0.45 $\\pm$ 0.05), and sub-solar C/O ratios for PZ Tel\n(0.28 $\\pm$ 0.05) and $\\beta$ Pic (0.22 $\\pm$ 0.06).

We find super-solar carbon and\noxygen for this stellar population, indicating that the protoplanetary disks\naround these stars were potentially rich in volatiles. We compare stellar C/O\nto those of their companions, revealing super-stellar C/O for several objects\nthat suggest planet-like formation mechanisms. We also compare the C/O of our\ndirectly imaged companion host star population with other planet host stars\nusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, which indicates insufficient evidence to\ndifferentiate between the various stellar populations"}
