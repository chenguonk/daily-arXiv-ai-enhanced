Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\\% but not more than 70\\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation."}

Supporting information to be published by the journal along with the paper", "summary": "Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase."}

Previous studies often used manual tuning or optimization methods to fit ablation and fragmentation models to optical meteor data, but subjective choices made physical properties and uncertainties difficult to compare. We develop a global, statistically robust method that uses Dynamic Nested Sampling to fit an erosion-fragmentation model to meteor light curves and deceleration measured by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system and Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras. Applied to 15 shower meteors, the method returns posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences for single- and double-fragmentation scenarios. Tests on four synthetic cases recover the known inputs, with best-guess solutions matching the true parameters. For 9 Orionids and 6 Alpha Capricornids with masses 1e-6 to 1e-5 kg, the median bulk density is 159 (+558/-57) kg/m3 for Orionids and 333 (+1089/-114) kg/m3 for Alpha Capricornids. Orionids are consistent with low-density cometary material, while Alpha Capricornids are systematically denser and show a second density cluster near 1300 kg/m3, consistent with higher-density asteroidal material. This framework enables automated, statistically rigorous characterization of meteoroid properties and will be extended to larger samples of shower and sporadic meteors across orbital classes."}

However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization."}

Although white dwarfs with detected planetary systems are more likely to show photospheric pollution, one notable exception - WD 1856+534 - hosts a close-in giant planet yet exhibits no detectable photospheric metal pollution. Previous studies have proposed that massive, close-in planets can block inward transport of small particles driven by radiative forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect). However, it remains unclear whether the close-in planet can similarly prevent delivery of larger bodies via dynamical interactions. We aim to quantify the protective influence of close-in planets on white-dwarf pollution by asteroids approaching on near-parabolic orbits, and to explore the planetary masses and orbital separations required to provide effective protection. We perform ensembles of short-term N-body integrations, sampling a range of planet masses and orbital separations and initializing asteroids on highly eccentric orbits with periapses near the WD Roche radius, in order to measure scattering, capture, and ejection outcomes and quantify the planet's shielding efficiency. For WD1856+534b-like configurations (a_p = 0.02 au), giant planets with masses greater than 0.5 Jupiter masses are sufficient to clear over 80% of highly eccentric small-body contaminants. The effectiveness of the protective effect diminishes with decreasing planetary mass and increasing semi-major axis. These findings help explain why some white dwarfs that host close-in giant planets do not show the photospheric metal pollution commonly observed in other systems."}

Mean motion resonances beyond 50 AU", "comment": "28 pages, 13 figures, 5 Tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study to date on Neptune's mean-motion resonances (MMRs) in the distant Kuiper belt from 50 to 100 AU. Over 200 resonant Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have been identified in this region, spanning resonances from the 2nd-order 1:3 MMR to the 22nd-order 7:29 MMR, with inclinations $i<40^\\circ$. Building on these diverse distributions, we first analyse the dynamical features of numerous $m$:$n$ MMRs, providing an informative database that includes the possible eccentricity ($e$) range, resonance widths, resonance centres, and permissible $(e,i)$ distributions. We then conduct numerical simulations to explore the long-term stability of these MMRs. Our results show that: (1) resonators can occupy all 1:$n$ to 7:$n$ MMRs, with nearly any $n$ corresponding to the 50-100 AU region, including the farthest-out MMRs of 5:29 (24th-order), 6:35 (29th-order), and 7:40 (33rd-order). This suggests that KBOs could potentially exist in even higher-order MMRs than those currently observed. (2) For each set of $m$:$n$ resonances with the same $m$, resonators consistently exhibit inclinations up to $40^\\circ$, while eccentricities remain strictly restricted below 0.7. (3) For the 1:3 and 1:4 MMRs, the leading population is less stable than the trailing population. Most interestingly, we discover a novel phenomenon of number reversal, where the higher-order, weaker 3:8 MMR (at semimajor axis $a\\approx57.9$ AU) hosts more resonators, rather than fewer as expected, compared to the lower-order, stronger 3:7 MMR (at $a\\approx53.0$ AU). Future observations, whether confirming or challenging this phenomenon, will offer valuable insight into the eccentricity and inclination distributions of primordial KBOs."}

While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $σ(λ)\\times \\dot M \\le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic."}

The detection of sodium in olivine cores has previously suggested very high saturating partial pressures of gaseous sodium, but we show that alkalis were lost during heating and recondensed at lower temperatures, essentially in the present-day chondrule mesostases. This recondensation was accompanied by mass-dependent enrichment in light isotopes (for multi-isotope alkalis such as K and Rb), but its limited extent indicates a cooling acceleration (or \"quenching\"). The isotopic fractionation also constrains the ratio of the chondrule density and the cooling rate prior to the quench around $10^{-6}\\:\\mathrm{kg.m^{-3}.K^{-1}.h}$ suggesting densities above $\\sim 10^{-6}\\:\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.

For the past 40 years, variable absorption features have been observed in the stellar spectrum, produced by the gaseous tails of exocomets transiting the star. Yet, despite the large number of observations available, the origin and dynamical evolution of the exocomets remain poorly understood. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of $β$ Pic, obtained on April 29, 2025, with the Hubble Space Telescope and the HARPS spectrograph. We report the detection of three strong exocomet signatures at low radial velocities (-7.5, +2.5 and +10 km/s), in a large set of lines from various species and excitation levels. We show that the three exocometary tails have different excitation states, indicating that they are located at different distances from the star. Using a detailed modelling of the excitation state of the transiting gas, which includes both radiative and collisional excitation, we derive the transit distance of the three exocometary gaseous tails to be $0.88 \\pm 0.08$, $4.7 \\pm 0.3$, and $1.52 \\pm 0.15$ au. These values are much larger than previous estimates, which generally placed the transient features within 0.2 au. This reveals that gaseous tails produced by exocomets sublimating close to the star can expand and migrate over large distances, while still remaining detectable in absorption spectroscopy. Our study provides a new method to measure the transit distance of exocomets, based on excitation modelling, complementing the acceleration method only applicable for high-velocity objects."}

In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\\rm{bin}}=4\\,M_\\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39\" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$α$ emission at 0.20\" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\\sim0.1Δ\\upsilon_{\\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features."}

We imaged $γ$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\\sim$0.02.
