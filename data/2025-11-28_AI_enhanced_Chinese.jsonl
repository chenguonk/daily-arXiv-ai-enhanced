The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\\dot{P} = 0.04\\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \\gtrsim 3.1 \\times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9WD 1856+534\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u51b7\u6728\u661f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u589e\u957f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76WD 1856+534\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51b7\u6728\u661f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6f6e\u6c50\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u5230\u8fbe\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4ece311\u4e2a\u5386\u5143\u6269\u5c55\u52301498\u4e2a\u5386\u5143\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u51cc\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u6f6e\u6c50\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4f34\u661f\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6052\u5b9a\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u8f68\u9053\u589e\u957f\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u884c\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50Q_p' \u2265 3.1\u00d710^6\uff1b\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u4e8e4.1M_J\u3001\u5468\u671f\u77ed\u4e8e1500\u5929\u7684\u4f34\u661f\uff1b\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u4e0a\u9650e<10^-2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5982\u679c\u884c\u661f\u786e\u5b9e\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6f6e\u6c50\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8fbe\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4f4e\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u8868\u660e\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5df2\u505c\u6b62\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u5c06\u7531\u5f31\u884c\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002"}}
