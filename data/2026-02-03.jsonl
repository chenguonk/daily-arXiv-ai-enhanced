Here, we present a composite catalog and modeling framework that extracts the maximum information from existing Hipparcos and Gaia data releases. We calibrate Gaia DR2 proper motions and DR3-DR2 scaled position differences against the Gaia DR3 reference frame, and combine these with the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations, the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data, Gaia astrometric excess noise, and Gaia radial velocity variability constraints. We implement a joint likelihood model for these data in Octofitter that marginalizes over Gaia's unpublished observation epochs. This results in full orbit posteriors that can be computed uniformly for a large class of companions. We compare these posteriors to published orbital solutions for 25 stellar binaries from the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars, recovering all companions at high significance and broadly consistent orbital separations. We then recover independent evidence to support 94 of 120 tested Jovian exoplanetary systems from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (plus 3 known stellar companions, and one previously detected planet we now rule out). We demonstrate that in cases like 14 Her b, the posteriors confirm the planetary nature of a signal using only Gaia and Hipparcos data. We find no false positives among 25 RV-quiet standard stars without significant Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations. Our method can break degeneracies inherent to proper motion anomaly or excess noise modeling alone by resolving orbital curvature within the Gaia baseline. The catalog and updated Octofitter are made publicly available to the community."}

In this work, we use the planetary evolution code VPLanet to assess the potential habitability of TOI-700d and TOI-700e. We first examine their orbital dynamics to evaluate the influence of planet-planet interactions on the planet spin, obliquity, and eccentricity. We then investigate whether these interactions are sufficient to cause either TOI-700d or e to be perturbed out of a habitable state, and whether we expect either planet could retain surface oceans over Gyr timescales. Together, these analyses allow us to assess the long-term habitability prospects of both TOI-700d and TOI-700e. We find that multi-planet interactions in the TOI-700 system do not prevent either planet from potentially retaining habitable conditions; however, we find that TOI-700e is located very near the boundary of the tidally locked habitable zone (arXiv:1705.10362), suggesting further work is needed to determine whether it is truly habitable."}

Though most NEOs are nominally anhydrous because they formed inside the Solar System frost line and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove volatiles, a 3-micron feature typically indicative of OH/H2O has been identified on several such bodies. Possible sources for OH/H2O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impactors or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. The MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey (MITHNEOS) began its 3-micron observation campaign of NEOs in 2022 and has obtained spectral data of 15 predominantly nominally anhydrous (i.e., mostly S-complex or V-type) targets using NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility's (IRTF) near-infrared spectrometer, SpeX. Spectra were collected using both prism (0.7-2.52 micron) and LXD_short (1.67-4.2 micron) modes to accurately characterize asteroid spectral type and the 3-micron region. Four of the 15 NEOs observed exhibit a 3-micron feature, exhibiting band shapes similar to those identified in a previous NEO survey (McGraw et al. 2022), which found a trend between hydration band presence and large aphelion (i.e., Q > 2.06 AU). Combining our new observations with the pre-existing database of NEO 2-4-micron data revealed that band depth increases with decreasing orbital inclination and that all NEOs with hydration bands have i < 27 degrees with most having i < 14 degrees. We find that NEOs with low inclination and large aphelia are the most likely bodies in near-Earth space to possess surficial OH/H2O."}

Recently, a couple of his epigones have appeared: Planet X and Planet Y. The former is a sort of minor version of Planet Nine in that all its physical and orbital parameters would be smaller. Instead, the latter would have a mass ranging from that of Mercury to the Earth's one and semimajor axis within 100-200 astronomical units. By using realistic upper bounds for the orbital precessions of Saturn, one can get insights on their position which, for Planet Nine, appears approximately confined around its aphelion. Planet Y can be just a Mercury-sized object at no less than about 125 astronomical units, while Planet X appears to be ruled out. Dedicated data reductions by modeling such perturber(s) are required to check the present conclusions, to be intended as hints of what might be detectable should planetary ephemerides include them.

Previous studies on this type of planets employed scaling analyses and two-dimensional (2D) simulations. This work is a continuation of the previous researches but including the effect of the Coriolis force and the simulation domain is extended to a 3D global sphere. We find that under the condition with thermal-only forcing (without surface wind stresses), the area-mean ocean depth is about 50--300 m (depending on vertical diffusivity) and the area-mean effect of horizontal ocean heat transport (in the order of 10$^{3}$ to 10$^{4}$ W m$^{-2}$) is significantly smaller than stellar radiation (in the order of 10$^{6}$ W m$^{-2}$ at the substellar region), being consistent with previous results. Different from 2D results, due to the effect of the Coriolis force, large-scale horizontal gyres form on the dayside, ocean currents near the west boundaries are much stronger than that near the east boundaries (called as ``western intensification''), the deepest ocean is not right at the substellar point but in the middle latitudes as the vertical diffusivity is moderate or large, and meanwhile there exists significant asymmetry between the west and the east of the substellar point. These results establish a first picture for the 3D thermal-driven ocean circulation and confirm that the lava ocean should be shallow on tide-locked lava worlds."}

The fiducial model exhibits several atmospheric layers, including the lower atmospheres controlled by day-night circulation, and transonic photoevaporative outflows at higher altitudes shaped into two spiral arms by the stellar gravity and orbital motion effects. Different species could trace different regions: Fe probes rotation-dominated inner layers, Na maps dense spiral arms where recombination balances photoionization, and H$α$ and He $10830~{\\rm A}$ features trace progressively more extended, ionized gas. With spiral arm velocities reaching $\\sim 40~{\\rm km\\ s}^{-1}$ projected along the line of sight, this morphology explains observed high-velocity Na and H$α$ absorption features without requiring significant super-rotation jet streams. Parametric studies reveal complex dependencies on stellar irradiation: enhanced FUV intensifies outflows and extends spiral arms spatially and kinematically, while EUV and X-ray expands spiral structures into attenuated, ionized regions. Stellar wind confinement compresses the dayside outflow and enhances metastable helium absorption. This work demonstrates that current and future transmission spectral observations that probe multiple species can provide important constraints on astrophysical environments of UHJs by comparing state-of-the-art simulations."}

One way to directly measure turbulent motion in disks is through molecular line broadening. DM Tau is one of only a few disks with claimed detection of nonthermal line broadening of 0.25cs-0.33cs, where cs is the sound speed. Using the radiative transfer code mcfost within a Bayesian inference framework that evaluates over five million disk models to efficiently sample the parameter space, we fit high-resolution (0.15\", 28 m s-1) 12CO J = 3-2 observations of DM Tau from the exoALMA Large Program. This approach enables us to simultaneously constrain the disk structure and kinematics, revealing a significant nonthermal contribution to the line width of ~0.4cs, inconsistent with purely thermal motions. Using the CO-based disk structure as a starting point, we reproduce the CS J = 7-6 emission well, demonstrating that the CS (which is more sensitive to nonthermal motions than CO) agrees with the turbulence inferred from the CO fit. Establishing a well-constrained background disk model further allows us to identify residual structures in the moment maps that deviate from the expected emission, revealing localized perturbations that may trace forming planets. This framework provides a powerful general approach for extracting disk structure and nonthermal broadening directly from molecular line data and can be applied to other disks with high-quality observations."}

We analyze 180 higher-resolution meteor spectra from the All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) network to identify meteoroids with atypical compositions. In addition to several iron bodies, we identify the first two achondritic meteoroids in our database, both likely meteorite-dropping impactors, and compare them with a reference ordinary chondrite meteoroid observed under similar conditions. Their spectra show strong compositional departures: one case has strong Mg and Si with low Fe, while the other has strong Ca, Al and Ti with low Mg. Derived relative elemental abundances imply an aubrite-like and a eucrite-like composition. The aubrite-like meteoroid exhibits unexpected enhancements in Ca, Mn and Ti in short-lived intensity spikes, which we interpret as rapid release of localized inclusions rather than bulk enrichment. This indicates that transient spectral features can reveal internal heterogeneity in achondritic meteoroids beyond their average composition. Dynamical and physical properties are consistent with these classifications: the eucrite-like meteoroid originated from an inner-main-belt orbit influenced by the $ν_6$ resonance and shows compact ablation with low erosion and an estimated bulk density of 3.16 $\\pm$ 0.10 g cm -3; the aubrite-like meteoroid came from a short-period, low-eccentricity orbit similar to some E-type near-Earth asteroids. Both events show atypical light curves, but our results indicate that robust identification of achondritic meteoroids in surveys generally requires emission spectra. This work presents one of the first detailed studies of achondrites from meteor observations and provides reference properties of atypical meteors for future surveys."}

This intense radiation drives photoevaporative winds that fundamentally shape disk evolution and chemistry. However, full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of these systems remain computationally expensive, preventing systematic exploration of the parameter space. We present a parametric framework for efficiently generating density structures of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds. Our approach implements a spherically diverging wind configuration with smooth transitions between the disk interior, the FUV-heated surface layer, and the wind itself. We validate this framework extensively against the FRIED grid of hydrodynamical simulations, demonstrating accurate reproduction of density structures across stellar masses from 0.3 to 3.0 M_sun, disk radii from 20 to 150 au, and external FUV fields from 100 to 100,000 G0. The complete framework is available as 'PUFFIN', a Python package that generates full 1D or 2D density structures in seconds to minutes, compared to weeks or months for equivalent hydrodynamical calculations. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this approach by modelling CO chemistry across a comprehensive parameter grid, using our density structures as inputs to thermochemical calculations. Our results show that external FUV irradiation significantly enhances CO gas-phase abundances through indirect heating mechanisms, which raise midplane temperatures and enhance thermal desorption of CO ice. This effect is strongest in the outer disk and scales with both external field strength and disk mass, with important implications for volatile budgets available to forming planets in clustered environments."}

The passage through the7/4 MMR between Miranda and Ariel", "comment": "Accepted for publication in Icarus", "summary": "The passage through the $5/3$ mean-motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel, two of Uranus's largest moons, still raises several open questions. Previous studies suggest that, in order to reproduce the current orbital configuration, Ariel must have had an eccentricity of approximately $\\sim 0.01$ before the resonance encounter, which would prevent resonant capture. However, the rapid tidal circularization of Ariel's orbit implies that some prior mechanism must have excited its eccentricity before the resonance encounter. In this work, we performed a large number of simulations using an N-body integrator to assess whether the earlier $7/4$ mean-motion resonance between Miranda and Ariel could serve as a mechanism to increase Ariel's eccentricity. Our results show that, due to divergent migration, resonance capture does not occur. As the satellites cross the nominal resonance, Ariel's eccentricity is only excited to $3.4 \\times 10^{-4}$, substantially smaller than the required value. Therefore, the $7/4$ mean-motion resonance is not a viable mechanism for increasing Ariel's eccentricity."}

Future telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will soon look for life on rocky worlds around Sun-like stars, so it is critical that we understand how to distinguish habitable planets from inhabited planets. However, it remains unknown if life is necessary to maintain a habitable planet, or how all of the components of an evolving planet impact habitability over time. To address these open questions, we present a coupled interior-atmosphere evolution model of the Earth without life from 50 Myr to 5 Gyr that reproduces 19 key observations of the pre-industrial Earth within measurement uncertainties after 4.5 Gyr. We also produce a reflected light spectrum covering the possible wavelength range of HWO. Our findings support the view that life is not required to maintain habitable surface conditions. The model presented here is apt for predicting the long-term habitability of Earth-like exoplanets via evolving bulk properties. By generating realistic reflected light spectra from evolved atmospheric states, this model represents significant progress towards whole-planet modeling, which may ultimately provide a robust abiotic baseline for interpreting biosignature observations with HWO."}

Scaling relations attempt to link the He I signal to XUV irradiation, mass loss, and bulk planetary parameters. We test these relations with a comparative analysis of HD209458b, HD189733b, HD149026b, and GJ1214b using a 1D hydrodynamic, multi-species, full-atmosphere escape model. For the benchmark HD209458b, our previously validated solution reproduces the observed He I and Ha transit depths without imposing composition constraints. HD189733b exhibits comparable He I depths, but the broadest reported profiles require ~12 km/s of additional non-thermal broadening, whereas more recent measurements are narrower, consistent with our predictions. For HD149026b, despite similar system properties, our model shows that higher gravity suppresses escape and enhances diffusive separation, depleting helium at high altitudes and yielding extremely weak He I absorption. For the sub-Neptune GJ1214b, H/He-only models overestimate He I absorption; including H2 and its ions (H2+, H3+, HeH+) lowers the escape rate and modifies the ion/electron balance, reducing the metastable helium densities. Compared against scaling relations, HD189733b observations and our HD149026b prediction fall below the trend, whereas some observations of HD209458b and GJ1214b are consistent; however, the observed transit depths are variable. Across all targets, we find diffusive separation of helium and hydrogen, which may explain why sub-solar He/H ratios are often required in simplified models. We conclude that interpreting He I and Ha absorption requires first-principles models that include self-consistent temperature and velocity profiles, multi-species transport, and molecular chemistry."}

Why not 0.01% or 99.99%? It has been previously suggested that this may represent a certain degree of fine-tuning, and thus perhaps observers are a-priori more likely to develop on those rare worlds with nearly equal land-ocean ratios, such as our own. In this work, we take the single datum of the Earth and then use Bayesian inference to compare four models for the probability distribution of a planet becoming inhabited by observers as a function of land-fraction, $f$, which we classify as i) land-centric ii) ocean-centric iii) equi-centric and iv) indifference. We find that no model is strongly favoured over the others, but that 1) the land-centric model is disfavoured over all others, and, 2) the equi-centric model is favoured over all competitors. Further, we show that more extreme models with heavy tail-weighting are strongly disfavoured even when conditioned upon the Earth alone. For example, a land-centric model where the median planet has $f=0.82$ (or greater) is in strong tension with our existence. Finally, we consider the potential addition of more data via Mars or exoplanets. Should paleo-Mars have once harboured life and had $f<0.20$, then this would strongly favour the ocean-centric model for life, over a land-centric hypothesis. We show that strong evidence for/against the equi-centric model versus its competitors would likely require at least a dozen inhabited exoplanets, offering a well-motivated sample size for future experiments."}
