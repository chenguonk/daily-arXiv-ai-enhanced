Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个建模架构来研究亚海王星大气中岩浆-大气相互作用的可观测特征，结合平衡化学和辐射对流模型，成功解释了TOI-270 d的观测光谱，表明岩浆-大气相互作用可能足以解释亚海王星大气中H2O、CH4和CO2等分子的高丰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期JWST观测发现多个亚海王星大气中存在高丰度的碳和氧分子，这些可能源于形成时冰质物质的吸积或岩浆-大气相互作用。先前研究大多局限于大气-地幔边界条件，未考虑对光谱观测可探测的上层大气的影响。

Method: 开发了一个建模架构，结合平衡化学代码（模拟核心、地幔和大气之间的反应）和辐射对流模型（确定可观测上层大气的组成和结构），研究不同大气-地幔边界条件以及不同核心和地幔组成对上层大气组成的影响。

Result: 模型与TOI-270 d的JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec观测结果吻合良好，无需过多调参。这表明岩浆-大气相互作用可能足以解释亚海王星大气中H2O、CH4和CO2等分子的高丰度，无需额外的冰质物质吸积。

Conclusion: 虽然其他过程也可能导致类似组成，但本研究强调了在解释亚海王星观测到的大气组成时考虑岩浆-大气相互作用的必要性。

Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact
with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and
magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST
observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules
in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes
including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere
interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere
interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at
the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper
atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we
present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of
magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which
models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a
radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the
observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the
atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact
the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec
observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide
a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This
suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high
abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune
atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the
protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar
compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere
interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a
sub-Neptune.

### [2] [Thin H$_2$-dominated Atmospheres as Signposts of Magmatic Outgassing on Tidally-Heated Terrestrial Exoplanets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07378)
*R. Arora,S. Ranjan,P. Moitra,A. Mallik*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文提出，近距离、高偏心率的类地系外行星可以通过潮汐驱动的火山脱气维持以H₂为主的大气层，并开发了一个内部-大气框架来评估这种大气在地质时间尺度上的可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以H₂为主的大气层虽然易于通过透射光谱进行表征，但通常被认为不稳定且容易逃逸。研究旨在探索在特定条件下这种大气层如何能够长期存在。

Method: 开发了一个结合内部氧化还原状态、潮汐加热、挥发性库存和行星参数的内部-大气框架，计算脱气通量并与能量限制的流体动力学逃逸进行对比分析。

Result: 研究发现，要维持H₂为主的大气层，类地系外行星需要具备水丰富的基底岩浆海洋、还原性熔体和高偏心率。薄H₂大气层的检测是当前岩浆脱气的标志。

Conclusion: 提出了结合精确质量-半径-偏心率测量与JWST对大气平均分子质量的约束来搜寻薄H₂大气层的方法，并指出对OZ区域系外行星的大气非检测可以约束行星内部特性。

Abstract: H$_2$-dominated terrestrial exoplanets are highly accessible to atmospheric
characterization via transmission spectroscopy, but such atmospheres are
generally thought to be unstable to escape. Here, we propose that close-in,
eccentric terrestrial exoplanets can sustain H$_2$-dominated atmospheres due to
intense tidally-driven volcanic degassing. We develop an interior-atmosphere
framework to assess whether volcanic outgassing can sustain \ch{H2}-dominated
atmospheres over geologic timescales ($\geq$1 Gyr). We incorporate interior
redox state, tidal heating, volatile inventory, and planetary parameters to
compute outgassing fluxes and confront them with energy-limited hydrodynamic
escape. We demonstrate that to sustain an H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, a
terrestrial exoplanet must have a water-rich basal magma ocean and reduced
melts, in addition to high eccentricity. We additionally demonstrate that
detection of a specifically thin H$_2$-dominated atmosphere is a sign of
current magmatic outgassing. We delineate an "outgassing zone" (OZ) most
favorable to the existence of such planets, and identify the most
observationally compelling targets. We propose combining precise
mass-radius-eccentricity measurements with JWST constraints on atmospheric mean
molecular mass $\mu$ to search for thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. Inversely,
we argue that robust atmospheric non-detections on OZ exoplanets can constrain
the planetary interior, including melt redox state, mantle melt fraction and
volatile inventory, and tidal heat flux.

### [3] [Enhanced Pebble Drift Across Planet-Opened Gaps in Windy Protoplanetary Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07428)
*Lorraine Nicholson,Jaehan Bae*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过二维多流体流体动力学模拟发现，在磁驱动风主导的气体吸积盘中，行星诱导的间隙无法有效过滤毫米级尘埃颗粒，这与传统粘性盘模型预测不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统盘吸积模型假设物质输运由粘性驱动，认为行星诱导的间隙能过滤大颗粒尘埃。但越来越多的证据表明物质输运可能由磁驱动风主导，需要研究这种机制下的尘埃过滤效率。

Method: 采用参数化风模型进行二维多流体流体动力学模拟，探索在磁驱动风主导气体吸积的盘中，尘埃过滤效率和被过滤尘埃颗粒大小的变化。

Result: 风驱动的向内气体流能使尘埃克服外间隙边缘的压力凸起并穿透行星诱导的间隙。最大能穿透间隙的尘埃颗粒尺寸随风强度增加而增大，强风条件下毫米级颗粒能穿透多木星质量行星打开的间隙。

Conclusion: 磁驱动风能显著增强卵石漂移并影响内原行星盘中的行星形成过程。

Abstract: When a giant planet forms in a protoplanetary disks, it carves a gap around
its orbit separating the disk into two parts: inner disk and outer disk.
Traditional disk accretion models, which assume material transport is driven by
viscosity, reveal that the planet-induced gap acts like a filter which blocks
large dust grains from flowing into the inner disk. However, there is growing
evidence that material transport may be driven by magnetically-driven winds
instead. By carrying out a suite of two-dimensional multi-fluid hydrodynamic
simulations where wind is implemented with a parameterized model, we explored
how dust filtration efficiency and the size of dust grains filtered change in
disks where gas accretion is dominated by magnetically-driven winds. We found
that the inward gas flow driven by the wind can enable dust to overcome the
pressure bump at the outer gap edge and penetrate the planet-induced gap. The
maximum size of dust grains capable of penetrating the gap increasing with the
wind strength. Notably, we found that when wind is strong (mass loss rate =
1e-7 M_sun/yr), mm-sized grains can penetrate the gap opened by a
multi-Jovian-mass planet. Our results suggest that magnetically driven winds
can significantly enhance pebble drift and impact planet formation in the inner
protoplanetary disk.

### [4] [An automated probabilistic asteroid prediscovery pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07588)
*Sage Li,Alex Geringer-Sameth,Nathan Golovich*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发了一种自动化概率方法，在档案巡天图像中预先发现近地小行星，通过重新拟合轨道和概率关联检测来减少轨道不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是在发现后立即减少近地小行星的轨道不确定性，通过档案图像中的预先发现来延长观测弧段。

Method: 重新拟合MPC天体测量数据，传播六参数协方差到巡天历元定义搜索区域；构建低阈值源目录，评估每个检测源作为候选预先发现；通过重新拟合轨道和概率关联消除误报。

Result: 在ZTF图像中识别约3000个有预先发现潜力的近地小行星，其中约500个观测弧段翻倍；成功预先发现2021 DG1和2025 FU24，显著减少轨道不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有巡天无关性和可扩展性，能够为Rubin、NEO Surveyor和NEOMIR的新发现提供快速轨道精化。

Abstract: We present an automated and probabilistic method to make prediscovery
detections of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in archival survey images, with the
goal of reducing orbital uncertainty immediately after discovery. We refit
Minor Planet Center astrometry and propagate the full six-parameter covariance
to survey epochs to define search regions. We build low-threshold source
catalogs for viable images and evaluate every detected source in a search
region as a candidate prediscovery. We eliminate false positives by refitting a
new orbit to each candidate and probabilistically linking detections across
images using a likelihood ratio. Applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
imaging, we identify approximately 3000 recently discovered NEAs with
prediscovery potential, including a doubling of the observational arc for about
500. We use archival ZTF imaging to make prediscovery detections of the
potentially hazardous asteroid 2021 DG1, extending its arc by 2.5 years and
reducing future apparition sky-plane uncertainty from many degrees to
arcseconds. We also recover 2025 FU24 nearly 7 years before its first known
observation, when its sky-plane uncertainty covers hundreds of square degrees
across thousands of ZTF images. The method is survey-agnostic and scalable,
enabling rapid orbit refinement for new discoveries from Rubin, NEO Surveyor,
and NEOMIR.

### [5] [From gas to ice giants: A unified mechanism for equatorial jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08020)
*Keren Duer-Milner,Nimrod Gavriel,Eli Galanti,Eli Tziperman,Yohai Kaspi*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种统一机制，通过对流驱动的柱状结构解释木星和冰巨星的赤道急流差异，将超旋转和亚旋转视为同一机制的不同稳定分支。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论无法同时解释气态巨行星（木星、土星）的赤道超旋转和冰巨星（天王星、海王星）的赤道亚旋转现象，但太阳系巨行星的参数表明不太可能存在根本不同的机制。

Method: 使用对流驱动的柱状结构模型，将赤道急流现象框架化为分岔问题，分析赤道波特性和主导动量平衡。

Result: 发现对流驱动的柱状结构能够同时产生向东和向西的赤道急流，超旋转和亚旋转是同一机制解的不同稳定分支。

Conclusion: 赤道急流形成的基本动力学机制在木星类行星中可能比先前认为的更具普适性，为两种不同的纬向风模式提供了统一解释。

Abstract: The equatorial jets dominating the dynamics of the Jovian planets exhibit two
distinct types of zonal flows: strongly eastward in the gas giants
(superrotation) and strongly westward in the ice giants (subrotation). Existing
theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single
mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of
the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different
mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar
structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing
the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and
subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our
analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of
equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests
that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more
broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering
a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.

### [6] [How Internal Structure Shapes the Metallicity of Giant Exoplanets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08280)
*Lorenzo Peerani,Saburo Howard,Ravit Helled*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究分析了不同内部结构假设如何影响气态巨行星的金属丰度推断及其与行星质量的相关性，发现金属总质量与行星质量正相关，而金属丰度与质量负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气态巨行星的组成和内部结构包含其形成和演化过程的关键信息，研究不同结构假设对金属丰度推断的影响有助于理解行星形成机制。

Method: 对44颗气态巨行星(0.12-5.98 MJ)使用CEPAM计算演化模型，在三种结构假设(核+包层、稀释核、完全混合)下反推其整体金属丰度。

Result: 所有结构都显示金属总质量与行星质量正相关，金属丰度与质量负相关。稀释核结构产生的金属丰度与核+包层模型相当，非绝热稀释核模型可使金属丰度增加达35%。

Conclusion: 质量-金属丰度反相关主要由低质量、富金属行星驱动，而大质量行星表现出意外高的金属丰度。改进对流混合约束结合未来精确测量将能更可靠推断内部结构和形成路径。

Abstract: The composition and internal structure of gas giant exoplanets encode key
information about their formation and subsequent evolution. We investigate how
different interior structure assumptions affect the inferred bulk metallicity
and its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets
(0.12-5.98 MJ), we compute evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieve their
bulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: Core+Envelope (CE),
Dilute Core (DC), and Fully Mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a
significant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (M_Z) and
planetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between metallicity (Z) and M
(also for Z/Z_star vs. M). DC structures yield metallicities comparable to CE
models, regardless of the assumed gradient extent. Increasing atmospheric
metallicity raises the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow
planetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved
metallicity by up to 35%. Sensitivity analyses show that the mass-metallicity
anti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets, while
massive planets exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities. Improved constraints
on convective mixing, combined with upcoming precise measurements of planetary
masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and
Ariel, will enable more robust inferences of interior structures and formation
pathways for gas giant planets.

### [7] [SOAPv4: A new step toward modeling stellar signatures in exoplanet research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08319)
*E. Cristo,J. P. Faria,N. C. Santos,W. Dethier,B. Akinsanmi,A. Barka,O. Demangeon,J. P. Lucero,A. M. Silva*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: SOAPv4是一个用于模拟恒星活动对径向速度测量和透射光谱影响的代码工具，通过模拟光球活动区域和行星凌星，研究恒星活动对吸收光谱的变形效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发SOAPv4旨在更好地建模恒星活动在径向速度测量中的影响，并研究其对透射光谱的变形效应，以改进系外行星探测的准确性。

Method: 使用SOAPv4模拟类太阳恒星上的光球活动区域和热木星凌星，通过改变输入光谱研究其对吸收光谱的影响，并与太阳观测和合成光谱进行比较。

Result: 模拟显示，颗粒化可以引入类似行星吸收特征的谱线变形，可能导致对大气动力学的误读。与ESPRESSO观测的比较表明，包含非局部热力学平衡效应的模型能更好地匹配HD 209458 b的吸收光谱。

Conclusion: SOAPv4能够有效模拟恒星活动对径向速度测量和透射光谱的色度效应，但现有模型仍无法完全复现所有观测到的谱线变形，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: We present and describe a new version of the spot oscillation and planet
code, SOAPv4. Our aim is to demonstrate its capabilities in modeling stellar
activity in the context of RV measurements and its effects on transmission
spectra. To do this, we employed solar observations alongside synthetic spectra
and compared the resulting simulations. We used SOAPv4 to simulate photospheric
active regions and planetary transits for a Sun-like star hosting a hot
Jupiter. By varying the input spectra, we investigated their impact on the
resulting absorption spectra and compared the corresponding simulations. We
then assessed how stellar activity deforms these absorption profiles. Finally,
we explored the chromatic signatures of stellar activity across different
wavelength ranges and discussed how such effects have been employed in the
literature to confirm planet detections in radial-velocity measurements. We
present the latest updates to SOAP, a tool developed to simulate active regions
on the stellar disk while accounting for wavelength-dependent contrast. This
functionality enables a detailed study of chromatic effects on radial-velocity
measurements. In addition, SOAPv4 models planet-occulted line distortions and
quantifies the influence of active regions on absorption spectra. Our
simulations indicate that granulation can introduce line distortions that mimic
planetary absorption features, potentially leading to misinterpretations of
atmospheric dynamics. Furthermore, comparisons with ESPRESSO observations
suggest that models incorporating non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects
provide an improved match to the absorption spectra of HD 209458 b, although
they do not fully reproduce all observed distortions.

### [8] [Direct Spectroscopy of 51 Eridani b with JWST NIRSpec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08327)
*Alexander Madurowicz,Jean-Baptiste Ruffio,Bruce Macintosh,Marshall Perrin,Quinn M. Konopacky,Aneesh Baburaj,Kielan Hoch*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用JWST/NIRSpec对系外行星51 Eridani b进行高对比度直接光谱观测，首次直接确认其大气中同时存在甲烷和一氧化碳，并提供了详细的大气模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低质量、低温系外行星51 Eridani b的大气成分，特别是验证甲烷和一氧化碳在化学非平衡状态下的共存情况。

Method: 使用JWST/NIRSpec固定狭缝配置进行高对比度直接光谱观测，采用交叉相关分析将连续谱减去的数据与大气前向模型进行比较。

Result: 在4.8σ置信度下检测到行星源分子信号，主要来自甲烷和一氧化碳特征，获得详细大气参数：有效温度800K、金属丰度0.7、C/O比0.458等。

Conclusion: 成功验证了51 Eridani b大气中甲烷和一氧化碳的共存，并讨论了固定狭缝与IFU高对比度光谱方法的经验教训和改进可能性。

Abstract: We present high-contrast direct spectroscopy of the low-mass, cool exoplanet
51 Eridani b (2-4 M$_\textrm{Jup}$, $\sim$750 K) using JWST / NIRSpec in a
fixed-slit configuration (F290LP / G395H, $3-5\,\mu$m, R$\sim$2,700). A cross
correlation analysis between the continuum-subtracted data and atmospheric
forward models indicates a detection of molecular signals of planetary origin
at $4.8\sigma$ at the expected position and velocity of the planet. The
detection of the planetary signal is driven primarily by molecular features
from methane and carbon monoxide, providing the first direct confirmation of
these two molecules coexisting in chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of
51 Eridani b. A new comprehensive atmospheric model analysis shows consistency
between the ground-based IFU spectroscopy and the NIRSpec data, with the
best-fit model parameters: $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 800$^{+21.5}_{-55.5}$ K, $\log g$
= 3.75$^{+0.09}_{-0.37}$, $[\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}]$ = 0.7$^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$,
$\textrm{C}/\textrm{O}$ = 0.458$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, $\log K_\mathrm{zz}$ =
3$^{+0.47}_{-0.73}$, $R_\mathrm{P}$ = 1.36$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ $R_\mathrm{Jup}$,
$f_\mathrm{hole}$ = 0.3$^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$, and the NIRSpec errorbar inflation
parameter: $\hat{e}$ = 1.74$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. We conclude with a discussion on
the lessons learned between the fixed slit and IFU-based high contrast
spectroscopic methods from our observing program, including some possibilities
to improve the analysis method.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Super-thermal gas giant planets or their progenitor cores are known to open
deep gaps in protoplanetary disks, which stop large, drifting dust particles on
their way to the inner disk. The possible separation of the disk into distinct
reservoirs and the resulting dust depletion interior to the gap have important
implications for planetesimal formation and the chemical and isotopic
composition of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Dust fragmentation,
however, maintains a reservoir of small grains which can traverse the gap. Dust
evolution models are thus instrumental for studies of a gap's filtration
efficiency. We present 2D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk
systems with dust coagulation and fragmentation. For the first time, we evolve
a series of 2D simulation with dust coagulation over 45000 planetary orbits and
track the dust's size evolution and origin by using the TriPoD dust coagulation
method. We investigate the effects of different planetary masses, fragmentation
velocities, and viscosities on the inner disk's dust mass budget and
composition, and highlight the advantages of multi-dimensional simulations over
1D models. Filtering can only be efficient for high planetary masses, high
fragmentation velocities, and low diffusivities. Clear compositional
distinctions between the inner and outer disk could not have been maintained by
Jupiter's core if the fragmentation velocity was low, even if $\alpha \lesssim
5 \times 10^{-4}$. Significant "contamination" of the inner disk by outer-disk
dust occurs in much less than $2 \times 10^5$ yr in this case and even for more
massive objects. This either places tight constraints on the physical
conditions in the Solar nebula or mandates consideration of alternative
explanations for the NC-CC dichotomy. Astrophysical constraints on the
parameters could discriminate between these possibilities.
