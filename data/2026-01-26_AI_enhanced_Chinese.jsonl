Among dynamical effects other than direct gravitational interactions, primary tides and gas drag cause the secondary's semi-major axis to evolve secularly. The consequences of these two effects on the mean ratios of secondary orbital distances are assessed for the four systems. A general relation is first derived to estimate a past initial mean distance ratio and is characterised for primary tides and for the drag caused by primordial nebulae. Results show first that the mean distance ratios of the four systems did not evolve sensibly under primary tidal action for periods corresponding to the age of the Solar System, and that the mean distance ratios are approximately conserved after the dissipation of initial nebulae. Secondly, the mean distance ratios may not have changed much due to gas drag caused by primaeval nebulae after formation of initial proto-secondaries and for periods corresponding to assumed lifetimes of nebulae, depending on initial nebulae models and on periods of effective drag. These results involve only the systems' mean distance ratios and do not imply that neither the secondary distances nor the individual distance ratios are conserved. Resonances among secondaries mean motions would reinforce the approximate conservation of mean distance ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6728\u661f\u3001\u571f\u661f\u3001\u5929\u738b\u661f\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u89c4\u5219\u536b\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea7\u6570\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e3b\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u6c14\u4f53\u963b\u529b\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u5728\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5e74\u9f84\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u89c4\u5219\u536b\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5448\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea7\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u4e3b\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u661f\u4e91\u6c14\u4f53\u963b\u529b\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u536b\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4f30\u7b97\u8fc7\u53bb\u521d\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u661f\u4e91\u6c14\u4f53\u963b\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6728\u661f\u3001\u571f\u661f\u3001\u5929\u738b\u661f\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5e74\u9f84\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u661f\u6f6e\u6c50\u4f5c\u7528\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u56db\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\uff1b2) \u521d\u59cb\u661f\u4e91\u6d88\u6563\u540e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b3) \u539f\u59cb\u661f\u4e91\u6c14\u4f53\u963b\u529b\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u661f\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u963b\u529b\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u5171\u632f\u4f1a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5f3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b88\u6052\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5355\u4e2a\u536b\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $\u03b1\\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9WD 0106-328\u767d\u77ee\u661f25\u5e74\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0MgII\u548cCaII\u8c31\u7ebf\u7b49\u503c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0cMg\u548cCa\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea620%\u548c60%\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u661f\u5468\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u767d\u77ee\u661fWD 0106-328\u4e2d\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5c18\u57c3\u6c61\u67d3\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u4e2d\u91d1\u5c5e\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLT\u548cKeck\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u572825\u5e74\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c6\u4e2a\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790MgII\u548cCaII\u8c31\u7ebf\u7b49\u503c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u5ca9\u77f3\u5f62\u6210\u5143\u7d20\uff08O\u3001Mg\u3001Si\u3001Fe\uff09\u3002", "result": "MgII\u548cCaII\u8c31\u7ebf\u7b49\u503c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53d1\u751f\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u6bd4\u503c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u6052\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u4ec57%\uff09\uff1b2000-2025\u5e74\u95f4Mg\u548cCa\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea620%\u548c60%\uff1bFe\u5728\u5438\u79ef\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u7eaf\u91d1\u5c5e\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ece\u5206\u5316\u7684\u6bcd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u8f93\u9001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u6c89\u964d\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5929\u91cf\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u6c14\u91d1\u5c5e\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u661f\u5468\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u7535\u79bb\u91d1\u5c5e\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u7c98\u6027\u6269\u6563\uff09\uff1b\u5316\u5b66\u5206\u5f02\u5438\u79ef\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u884c\u661f\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u76d8\u6f14\u5316\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

While the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will transform Solar System science, its observing cadence and survey design were not specifically optimized to discover imminent impactors. To assess its performance, we introduce a new method for efficiently generating synthetic impactor populations by minimally perturbing sampled NEOMOD3 orbits and evaluate their discovery efficiency with the Sorcha survey simulator. Our simulations show that LSST discovers 79.7% of large impactors (>140 m), decreasing to 50.3% for upper mid-sized (50-140 m), 26.8% for lower mid-sized (20 - 50 m), and 10.5% for small objects (10-20 m). Warning times of the discovered impactors show a similar size dependence: small objects are typically discovered only weeks before impact (median:12.4 days), lower mid-sized within a month (median: 21.5 days), and upper mid-sized objects on timescales of a few months (median: 106.2 days). 39.0% of large impactors are discovered more than a year before impact, lacking long-lead warning despite their brightness. A loss-mode analysis reveals the underlying cause that small impactors are limited mainly by photometric sensitivity, whereas mid-sized and large objects are missed primarily due to cadence and linking constraints from LSST and its Solar System Processing (SSP) Pipelines. These results show that LSST excels at discovering faint, small impactors, but cannot by itself guarantee long-lead warning across the hazardous size spectrum. Coordinated multi-survey strategies will therefore be essential in the LSST era to achieve robust planetary-defense capability, and we study a complementary high-cadence, shallow-depth example with the Argus Array.", "AI": {"tldr": "LSST\u80fd\u53d1\u73b079.7%\u7684\u5927\u578b\u649e\u51fb\u4f53(>140m)\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b\u649e\u51fb\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51cf\u5c0f\u800c\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5de1\u5929\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u540c", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LSST\u5de1\u5929\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u649e\u51fb\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u649e\u51fb\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u6270NEOMOD3\u8f68\u9053\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u649e\u51fb\u4f53\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Sorcha\u5de1\u5929\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30LSST\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u649e\u51fb\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\u548c\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4", "result": "LSST\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u649e\u51fb\u4f53(>140m)\u53d1\u73b0\u738779.7%\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5c0f\u578b(10-20m)\u4ec510.5%\uff1b\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u7684\u6570\u6708\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u7684\u4ec5\u6570\u5468\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u968f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53d8\u5316", "conclusion": "LSST\u867d\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u6697\u5f31\u5c0f\u578b\u649e\u51fb\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8c31\u7cfb\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u9700\u8981Argus Array\u7b49\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u6d45\u6df1\u5ea6\u5de1\u5929\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c"}}

TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u4e86TOI-6692 b\uff0c\u4e00\u9897\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f130\u5929\u3001\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u7ea60.54\u7684\u504f\u5fc3\u6728\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u5c11\u6570\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u957f\u5468\u671f\u884c\u661f\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u957f\u5468\u671f\uff08>100\u5929\uff09\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6f6e\u6c50\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u884c\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7TESS\u5de1\u5929\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u51cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ea6\u54f2\u4f26\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684PFS\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u8fdb\u884c\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u76d1\u6d4b\u786e\u8ba4\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u8865\u5145CHIRON\u3001FEROS\u548cCORALIE\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LCOGT\u5730\u57fa\u5149\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u51cc\u661f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5468\u671f\u7cbe\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4TOI-6692 b\u4e3a\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f130\u5929\u3001\u504f\u5fc3\u73870.54\u7684\u6728\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u6f6e\u6c50\u8fc1\u79fb\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u884c\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u957f\u671f\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5916\u4f34\u661f\u3002", "conclusion": "TOI-6692 b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5de8\u884c\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5730\u57fa\u5149\u5ea6\u8bbe\u65bd\u5728\u51cc\u661f\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u661f\u5386\u8868\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\u786e\u8ba4\u5468\u671f\u3002"}}

All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$\u03c7$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$\u03c7$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process.

Comet Comments Welcome!", "summary": "The environs of other stellar systems may be directly probed by analyzing the cometary activity of interstellar objects. The recently discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was the subject of an intensive worldwide follow-up campaign in its pre-perihelion approach. Now, 3I/ATLAS has begun its post-perihelion departure from the Solar System. In this letter, we report the first post-perihelion blue-sensitive integral-field unit spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager on November 16, 2025. We confirm previously reported CN, Fe, and Ni outgassing along with detections of carbon chain molecules $\\mathrm{C}_2$ and $\\mathrm{C}_3$. We calculate production rates for each species. We find Fe and Ni production rates of $\\mathrm{Q_{Fe}} = (9.55\\pm3.96)\\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and $\\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} = (6.61\\pm2.74)\\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, resulting in a ratio of $\\log(\\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \\mathrm{Q_{Fe}}) = -0.16\\pm0.03$, which matches Solar System comets well and continues the pre-perihelion trend of declining $\\log(\\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \\mathrm{Q_{Fe}})$ with $r_h$. We investigate the radial distributions of these elemental species and find characteristic $e$-folding radii of 3880$\\pm$39 km for Ni, 6053$\\pm$68 km for CN, 4194$\\pm$45 km for $\\mathrm{C}_2$, and 3833$\\pm$45 km for $\\mathrm{C}_3$. Compared to pre-perihelion measurements, these radii have increased by a factor of $\\sim$6.5--7. Our post-perihelion observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS continues to exhibit cometary behavior broadly consistent with Solar System comets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u661f\u9645\u5929\u4f533I/ATLAS\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u5f57\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u53ca\u5f84\u5411\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f57\u661f\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u9645\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5f57\u661f\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5176\u4ed6\u6052\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\u30023I/ATLAS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u661f\u9645\u5929\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u524d\u540e\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u9645\u5f57\u661f\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51ef\u514b\u5b87\u5b99\u7f51\u6210\u50cf\u4eea\uff08Keck Cosmic Web Imager\uff09\u57282025\u5e7411\u670816\u65e5\u5bf93I/ATLAS\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u84dd\u8272\u654f\u611f\u79ef\u5206\u89c6\u573a\u5355\u5143\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86CN\u3001Fe\u3001Ni\u7684\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u78b3\u94fe\u5206\u5b50C2\u548cC3\u3002\u6d4b\u5f97Fe\u548cNi\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a(9.55\u00b13.96)\u00d710\u00b2\u2075\u548c(6.61\u00b12.74)\u00d710\u00b2\u2075 atoms/s\uff0c\u5176\u6bd4\u503c\u4e3a-0.16\u00b10.03\uff0c\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f57\u661f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6d4b\u5f97\u5404\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u7279\u5f81e\u6298\u53e0\u534a\u5f84\uff1aNi 3880\u00b139 km\uff0cCN 6053\u00b168 km\uff0cC2 4194\u00b145 km\uff0cC3 3833\u00b145 km\uff0c\u6bd4\u524d\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ea66.5-7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "3I/ATLAS\u5728\u540e\u8fd1\u65e5\u70b9\u9636\u6bb5\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f57\u661f\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f57\u661f\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u661f\u9645\u5f57\u661f\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u5f57\u661f\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}
