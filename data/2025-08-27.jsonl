Tidal dissipation within host stars\ncan cause the orbits of such planets to decay. However, the mechanisms of tidal\ndissipation are difficult to probe. Generally, tidal dissipation is\nparameterized by the modified stellar tidal quality factor, or $Q_{*}^{'}$, but\nthe lack of observational evidence of orbital decay to confirm dissipation\ntheories has resulted in orders of magnitude of uncertainty in $Q_{*}^{'}$. We\npresent a new transit timing analysis of 54 systems with varying stellar\nevolutionary states in an attempt to search for orbital decay across multiple\nstages of stellar evolution. For each system, we obtained mid-transit times\nfrom new TESS data and evaluated potential departures from a linear ephemeris\nusing the Bayesian Information Criterion. We then determined tidal quality\nfactors using widely tested theoretical relations. Of the systems studied, 25\nshowed evidence of a decrease in orbital period over time and 8 showed evidence\nof a decrease that was inconsistent with 0 by three standard deviations:\nCoRoT-2, TrES-5, WASP-4, WASP-12, WASP-19, WASP-45, WASP-99, and XO-3.

Similarly, we see that the lower limit on\n$Q_{*}^{'}$ for evolved systems is marginally lower than it is for the sample\nof all systems, though both limits are orders of magnitude below the expected\ntheoretical values for both samples. These new constraints on transit times and\n$Q_{*}^{'}$ values will help to narrow the search for orbital decay in the\nfuture and place important constraints on current theories of star-planet\ninteractions."}

In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual\nasteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary\nasteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and\nBYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D\nconduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered\ninfrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from\nhorizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and\nsecondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706)\n1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3\nsystem experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses\nand thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with\na mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also\npresent a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical\nmodel results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the\nBYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and\nthermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP\ncoefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by\napproximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small,\nin the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the\nsemimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that\nthermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that\nthey should be included when modeling binaries.

We used photochemistry and climate modeling to further\nexplore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship by modeling Earth-like planets with the\npresent atmospheric level (PAL) of O$_2$ between 0.01% to 150% along with high\nand low CH$_4$ abundances of 1000% and 10% PAL, respectively. Methane is of\ninterest not only because it is a biosignature, but also the source of hydrogen\natoms for hydrogen oxide (HO$_x$) which destroys O$_3$ through catalytic cycles\nand acts as a catalyst for the smog mechanism of O$_3$ formation in the lower\natmosphere. We find varying CH$_4$ causes changes to the O$_2$-O$_3$\nrelationship in ways that are highly dependent on both host star and O$_2$\nabundance. A striking result for high CH$_4$ models in high O$_2$ atmospheres\naround hotter hosts is that enough CH$_4$ is efficiently converted into H$_2$O\nto significantly impact stratospheric temperatures, and therefore the\nformation/destruction rates of O$_3$. Changes in HO$_x$ also influenced the\nHO$_x$ catalytic cycle and smog O$_3$, causing variations in harmful UV\nreaching the surface as well as changes in the 9.6~$\\mu$m O$_3$ feature in\nemission spectra. This demonstrates the need to explore the O$_2$-O$_3$\nrelationship in order to use O$_3$ as a reliable proxy for O$_2$ in future\nobservations."}

The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to\nstrongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes (100 bar-100 kbar) and\natmospheres (1 mbar-100 bar). At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, >10\nkbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas\nbehaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute\nequilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of\nstate in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune\npotentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in\nmagma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental\ndata on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at\nthe MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\\times$ solar, but is supplanted by\nCH$_4$ at 100$\\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both\nmagma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in\nmagma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry\nthrough the atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that condensation of\n$\\beta$-quartz 'clouds' depletes Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains\nabundant at solar metallicity. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ ratios increase with mantle melt\nfraction and decrease with metallicity. These effects also deplete H$_2$ via\nCH$_4$ and SiH$_4$ formation and the dissolution of H$_2$ into magma. The\ncompetition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ presents a diagnostic of metallicity and\nmagma oceans. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$- and\nCH$_4$-poor (<5%) atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma\noceans on sub-Neptunes."}
