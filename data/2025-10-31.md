### [1] [Atmospheric collapse and re-inflation through impacts for terrestrial planets around M dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25896)
*Prune C. August,Robin Wordsworth,Mikayla Huffman,David Brain,Lars A. Buchhave*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过能量平衡模型和随机撞击模拟，研究发现中等大小撞击体（5-10公里直径）可以在地球系外行星上再生可观测的瞬态CO₂大气层，这些行星的大气演化可能不是单调的，而是由外部事件周期性重塑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测类地系外行星大气层是重要里程碑，但观测偏向于潮汐锁定的M矮星近轨行星。这些行星大气易因夜间挥发物凝结而侵蚀和塌陷，但塌陷的挥发物作为夜间冰稳定储存，可通过陨石撞击重新蒸发重建大气。

Method: 应用简单能量平衡模型进行大气演化模拟，结合随机撞击事件，评估CO₂大气通过撞击再生的可行性和重要性。

Result: 中等大小撞击体（5-10公里直径）以1-100 Gyr⁻¹频率可在先前无大气的行星上再生可观测的瞬态CO₂大气。对JWST DDT Rocky Worlds计划的具体目标计算显示，GJ 3929 b、LTT 1445 Ac、LTT 1445 Ab分别有70%、50%、80%的演化时间具有这种瞬态大气。

Conclusion: 类地行星大气演化可能不是单调的，而是由外部强迫事件周期性塑造。大气塌陷可在M矮星早期高XUV演化阶段保护挥发物免于逃逸。

Abstract: Detection of an atmosphere around a terrestrial exoplanet will be a major
milestone in the field, but our observational capacities are biased towards to
tidally locked, close-in planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. The atmospheres of
these planets are vulnerable to atmospheric erosion and collapse due to
condensation of volatiles on the nightside. However, these collapsed volatiles
accumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be
re-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a
simple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with
stochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism
for CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \rm{km}$
diameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate
observable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets. We focus on
specific targets from the JWST DDT Rocky Worlds programme, and compute the
fraction of their evolution spent with a transient CO$_2$ atmosphere generated
through this mechanism. We find this fraction can reach $70\%$ for GJ 3929 b,
$50\%$ for LTT 1445 Ac, $80\%$ for LTT 1445 Ab, at high impact rates and strong
CO$_2$ outgassing over the planet's lifetime. We also show that atmospheric
collapse can shield volatiles from escape, particularly in the early, high-XUV
phase of M-dwarf evolution. Overall, our work suggests that terrestrial planet
atmospheres may not evolve monotonically but instead may be shaped by episodic
external forcings.

### [2] [NEOForCE: Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25923)
*Dmitrii E. Vavilov,Daniel Hestroffer*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: NEOForCE是一个独立的小行星撞击监测系统，使用DynAstVO轨道数据和创新的不确定性传播方法，为行星防御提供替代验证方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测系统如Sentry-II、CLOMON2和Aegis虽然成功，但需要独立方法来确保可靠性和交叉验证预测结果。

Method: 从不确定性区域采样数千个虚拟小行星，将其轨道积分至100年后；寻找地球接近这些虚拟小行星现实不确定性区域的时间；计算最大撞击概率，仅在概率足够大时进行下一步；修改原始轨道以确认可能的碰撞并估算撞击概率。

Result: 在五个代表性小行星上测试，NEOForCE成功复现了Sentry-II报告的大多数概率高于e-7的碰撞，并识别出Sentry-II未报告的e-7至e-6级别的潜在撞击。

Conclusion: NEOForCE证明了其方法的稳健性，为小行星撞击预测提供了可靠的独立验证系统。

Abstract: Robust impact monitoring of near-Earth objects is an essential task of
planetary defense. Current systems such as NASA's Sentry-II, the University of
Pisa's CLOMON2, and ESA's Aegis have been highly successful, but independent
approaches are essential to ensure reliability and to cross-validate
predictions of possible impacts. We present NEOForCE (Near-Earth Objects'
Forecast of Collisional Events), a new independent monitoring system for
asteroid impact prediction. By relying on orbital solutions from DynAstVO at
Paris Observatory and using an original methodology for uncertainty
propagation, NEOForCE provides an alternative line of verification for impact
assessments and strengthens the overall robustness of planetary defense. As
other monitoring systems, NEOForCE samples several thousand virtual asteroids
from the uncertainty region and integrates their orbits up to 100 years into
the future. Instead of searching for close approaches of the virtual asteroids
with the Earth, our system looks for times when the Earth comes close to the
realistic uncertainty regions around them, which are mostly stretched along
their osculating orbits. We also estimate the maximal impact probability, and
only if this value is large enough do we continue to the next step. In this
second step, we compute how the original asteroid orbit should be modified so
that the new trajectory leads to an Earth impact, which allows us to confirm
the possible collision and estimate the impact probability. We tested NEOForCE
against NASA's Sentry-II system on five representative asteroids: 2000 SG344,
2005 QK76, 2008 JL3, 2023 DO and 2025 JU. NEOForCE successfully recovered
nearly all possible collisions reported by Sentry-II with impact probabilities
above e-7, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. In addition, NEOForCE
identified several potential impacts at the e-7 - e-6 level that Sentry-II did
not report.

### [3] [Potential Thermal Profiles of The Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25945)
*Atsuhiro Yaginuma,Aster G. Taylor,Darryl Z. Seligman*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 通过热演化模型分析第三颗星际天体3I/ATLAS，基于其挥发物活动观测数据约束其物理性质，特别是反照率上限为0.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究星际天体3I/ATLAS的物理性质，通过热演化模型与挥发物活动观测对比，深入了解这类罕见天体的基本特性。

Method: 建立一维热剖面模型，计算3I/ATLAS在其双曲线轨迹上的径向温度分布，考虑典型彗星和小行星的物理参数（热容、密度、导热性），并与H2O、CO2、CO的升华温度进行基准比较。

Result: 模型表明，在3天文单位处观测到H2O活动时，表面温度需超过约150K，这要求反照率低于0.2，因此确定3I/ATLAS的反照率上限为0.2。

Conclusion: 通过热演化模型成功约束了3I/ATLAS的反照率上限为0.2，为理解星际天体的物理性质提供了重要线索。

Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic
interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal
profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain
bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing
a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional
thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its
trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on
measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid
bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and
conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth
throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the
thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal
profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O,
CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the
modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3
au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be
achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the
albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.

### [4] [How does ice shell geometry shape ocean dynamics on icy moons?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25988)
*Yixiao Zhang,Wanying Kang,John Marshall*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 极地变薄的冰壳通过压力导致的冰点抑制在冰卫星地下海洋中驱动环流，形成经向温度梯度。这种温度梯度产生浮力梯度，与垂直混合共同影响海洋特征，包括热风平衡的纬向流、斜压不稳定性、涡旋热输送和垂直分层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究冰壳厚度变化如何影响冰卫星地下海洋的环流过程，特别是斜压涡旋在大尺度环流和热输送中的主导作用，以及地形坡度对环流强度的影响。

Method: 使用高分辨率数值模拟，探索不同地形坡度、极地-赤道温差和垂直混合强度条件下，淡水和咸水海洋的环流特征。

Result: 斜压涡旋主导大尺度环流和经向热输送。当较轻水体覆盖较密水体时，环流减弱；当较密水体位于极地下方时，环流增强。建立了预测热输送和分层的尺度框架。

Conclusion: 将该框架应用于土卫二、木卫二和土卫六，推断海洋热通量、分层和潮汐能量耗散，表明大尺度环流约束潮汐加热，并将未来冰厚度和旋转观测与地下海洋动力学联系起来。

Abstract: A poleward-thinning ice shell can drive circulation in the subsurface oceans
of icy moons by imposing a meridional temperature gradient--colder at the
equator than the pole--through the freezing point suppression due to pressure.
This temperature gradient sets a buoyancy gradient, whose sign depends on the
thermal expansion coefficient determined by ocean salinity. Together with
vertical mixing, this buoyancy forcing shapes key oceanic features, including
zonal currents in thermal wind balance, baroclinic instability of those
currents, meridional heat transport by eddies, and vertical stratification. We
use high-resolution numerical simulations to explore how variations in ice
shell thickness affect these processes. Our simulations span a wide range of
topographic slopes, pole-to-equator temperature differences, and vertical
mixing strengths, for both fresh and salty oceans. We find that baroclinic
eddies dominate large-scale circulation and meridional heat transport,
consistent with studies assuming a flat ice-ocean interface. However, sloped
topography introduces new effects: when lighter water overlies denser water
along the slope, circulation weakens as a stratified layer thickens beneath the
poles. Conversely, when denser water lies beneath the poles, circulation
strengthens as topography increases the available potential energy. We develop
a scaling framework that predicts heat transport and stratification across all
simulations. Applying this framework to Enceladus, Europa, and Titan, we infer
ocean heat fluxes, stratification, and tidal energy dissipation and showing
large-scale circulation constrains tidal heating and links future observations
of ice thickness and rotation to subsurface ocean dynamics.

### [5] [Hot Jupiter Origin and Tidal Evolution Constrained by a Broken Age-Frequency Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26084)
*Di-Chang Chen,Ji-Wei Xie,Ji-Lin Zhou,Fei Dai,Bo Ma,Songhu Wang,Chao Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 热木星具有多种形成机制，早期形成占主导但约40%为晚期形成，通过潮汐理论约束了太阳型恒星的潮汐质量因子，为热木星的多通道形成提供了统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热木星的发现挑战了经典行星形成理论，其主导形成机制和相对贡献尚不明确，同时热木星为测试潮汐理论和测量潮汐质量因子提供了独特机会。

Method: 基于具有运动学特性的单太阳型恒星周围的热木星样本，分析其频率随时间的下降趋势，结合理论预期进行拟合，约束潮汐因子和不同形成通道的相对重要性。

Result: 发现热木星频率在约20亿年处出现脊状结构，表明热木星具有不同时间尺度的多起源；约束了太阳型恒星的潮汐因子，与观测到的轨道衰减热木星数量一致；约40%的热木星在数十亿年时间尺度上通过长期混沌机制晚期形成。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个统一框架，调和了热木星人口统计和长期演化与多通道形成机制，证实热木星具有早期和晚期两种主要形成路径。

Abstract: The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation
theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant
channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters
offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental
tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based
on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties,
{we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at
about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with
multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical
expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which
aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay.
Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different
channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within
several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk
migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant
portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale
extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further
supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our
findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics
and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.

### [6] [Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26308)
*R. Maggiolo,F. Dhooghe,G. Gronoff,J. de Keyser,G. Cessateur*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: JWST和SPHEREx观测发现3I/ATLAS彗星具有极高的CO2富集度（CO2/H2O = 7.6±0.3），超出太阳系彗星趋势4.5σ，这是由银河宇宙射线处理星际彗星外层所致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究星际彗星3I/ATLAS的化学成分，以了解其形成环境和演化历史。

Method: 使用JWST/NIRSpec和SPHEREx进行光谱观测，结合实验室模拟银河宇宙射线照射实验。

Result: 发现前所未有的CO2富集度和显著的CO含量，表明彗星外层由受银河宇宙射线处理的材料组成，当前释放气体仅来自处理层（深度15-20米）。

Conclusion: 长期存在的星际天体主要显示银河宇宙射线处理的材料，而非代表其原始形成环境的原始材料，这代表了研究范式的转变。

Abstract: Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx
reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above
solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This
unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O
= 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic
cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet
nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently
converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the
outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are
consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed
spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that
current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never
reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after
perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents
a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal
GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their
primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in
October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this
interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary
pathway for interstellar objects.

### [7] [In space there will be no need to scream - Limits to the presence of giant planets in the $ζ^2$ Ret system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26483)
*A. Suárez Mascareño*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究分析了ζ² Ret恒星28.8年的径向速度数据，旨在探测被怀疑为技术信号源的Calpamos巨行星，但最终排除了该行星的存在，并证明观测到的信号源于恒星磁活动周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找太阳系外生命是长期而困难的任务。当前主要关注生物标志物探测，但其检测和解释极具挑战性。技术标志物因其明确的解释性成为有吸引力的替代方案，近年来相关研究激增。

Method: 使用28.8年存档径向速度数据，进行全局模型拟合，结合活动指标建模恒星磁周期和自转，分析排除行星存在的可能性。

Result: 分析排除了Calpamos行星的存在，以及任何质量超过2-20地球质量的行星。先前识别的长周期径向速度信号被确认为由恒星磁周期引起。

Conclusion: 研究证实了恒星磁活动对径向速度测量的重要影响，为未来系外行星探测提供了重要参考，强调了区分行星信号与恒星活动信号的必要性。

Abstract: The search for life beyond our Solar system has been a long and difficult
endeavour. The majority of current efforts are focused on the potential
detection of biosignatures. However, their detection and interpretation are
extremely challenging. Technosignatures appear as an attractive alternative,
given their expected univocal interpretation. In recent years, the number of
publications discussing them have skyrocketted, both in their more rigurous and
speculative sides. In this article, we explore the 28.8 years of archival
radial velocity data of $\zeta^2$ Ret with the aim of detecting the proposed
giant planet Calpamos, suspected source of a signal of technological origin. We
performed a global model fitting the radial velocity data along with activity
indicators and modelled the stellar magnetic cycle and rotation. The analysis
rules out the presence of the proposed planet, as well as of any other planets
more massive than 2-20 $\mathrm{M}_\oplus$ $m_{p}$ sin $i$, depending on
orbital period. We show that the previously identified long-period RV signal is
definitively caused by the magnetic cycle of the star.

### [8] [Combined Orbital and Thermal Evolution of Oort Cloud Comets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26549)
*Adam Parhi,Dina Prialnik*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个完全集成的彗星演化模型，将热力学、成分和动力学过程从形成到现今活动连续耦合。研究发现不同尺寸彗星在演化过程中挥发物保存情况不同，并确定了不同距离下驱动彗星活动的主要机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够连续模拟彗星从形成到现今活动的完整演化模型，理解彗星在不同演化阶段的热力学、成分和动力学过程如何相互作用。

Method: 建立耦合的热力学-成分演化代码与动力学模型，考虑轨道参数变化、多种挥发物、气体在多孔介质中的流动、非晶冰结晶、挥发物的升华和再冻结等过程。模拟了2、10和50公里半径的彗星模型在46亿年间的演化。

Result: 小尺寸彗星中的CO冰完全耗尽，而大尺寸彗星从500米深度到中心保留了CO冰；CO2和非晶冰在所有尺寸彗星中完全保留。彗星活动在不同距离由不同机制驱动：CO升华（最远50天文单位）、CO2升华（13天文单位以内）、非晶冰结晶释放气体（约7天文单位）。放射性加热效应可忽略。

Conclusion: 彗星尺寸对其挥发物保存有重要影响，不同挥发物在不同距离驱动彗星活动，CO2在较远距离（25天文单位）仍可被探测到。

Abstract: We present a fully integrated model of comet evolution that couples thermal
and compositional processes with dynamical processes continuously, from
formation to present-day activity. The combined code takes into account changes
in orbital parameters that define the heliocentric distance as a function of
time, which is fed into the thermal/compositional evolution code. The latter
includes a set of volatile species, gas flow through the porous interior,
crystallization of amorphous ice, sublimation and refreezing of volatiles in
the pores. We follow the evolution of three models, with radii of 2, 10 and 50
km for 4.6 Gyr, through different dynamical epochs, starting in the vicinity of
Neptune, moving to the Oort Cloud and after a long sojourn there, back inward
to the planetary region. The initial composition includes a mixture of CO, CO2
ices, amorphous water ice with trapped CO and CO2, and dust.We find that the CO
ice is completely depleted in the small object, but preserved in the larger
ones from a depth of 500 m to the center, while the CO2 and the amorphous ice
are entirely preserved. Of crucial importance is the change in CO abundance
profiles during the cooling phase, as the objects migrate to the OC. Upon
return from the Oort Cloud, the activity is driven by CO sublimation at large
heliocentric distances (up to 50 au), by CO2 inward of 13 au and by gas
released from crystallizing amorphous ice at about 7 au. We test the effect of
radioactive heating by long-lived isotopes and find that it is negligible.
Considering sub-solar temperatures and limited active areas, we show that CO2
production rates can exceed the detection limit as far out as 25 au.

*Joshua D. Lothringer,Nataliea Lowson,Guangwei Fu*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 开发了ExoComp工具包和系外行星大气成分测量库，用于标准化比较系外巨行星的大气成分，发现了系外行星金属丰度系统增强、C/O比严格限制在0-1之间，以及不同观测方法之间的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系外行星的总体元素组成可以提供行星形成和演化历史的信息，目前已有数十颗行星通过贝叶斯大气反演获得测量数据，需要标准化工具进行群体层面的比较。

Method: 收集系外巨行星成分测量数据建立数据库，开发开源工具包ExoComp来标准化太阳丰度、金属丰度和C/O比的定义，分析不同观测方法（直接、掩食、透射光谱）的差异。

Result: 发现系外行星金属丰度相比T矮星和恒星群体系统增强，C/O比严格限制在0-1之间，不同观测方法之间存在统计显著差异，特别是透射光谱观测的行星C/O比系统偏低。

Conclusion: 气态巨行星大气表现出比太阳系和内部模型约束更陡的质量-金属丰度趋势，ExoComp工具和数据库可以增强系外行星科学研究的科学回报。

Abstract: The present-day bulk elemental composition of an exoplanet can provide
insight into a planet's formation and evolutionary history. Such information is
now being measured for dozens of planets with state-of-the-art facilities using
Bayesian atmosphere retrievals. We collect measurements of exoplanet
composition of gas giants into a Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition
Measurements for comparison on a population level. We develop an open-source
toolkit, ExoComp, to standardize between solar abundance, metallicity, and C/O
ratio definitions. We find a systematic enhancement in the metallicity of
exoplanets compared to T-dwarf and stellar populations, a strict bound in C/O
between 0 and 1, and statistically significant differences between measurements
from direct, eclipse, and transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the transit
spectroscopy population exhibits a systematically lower C/O ratio compared to
planets observed with eclipse and direct spectroscopy. While such differences
may be astrophysical signals, we discuss many of the challenges and subtleties
of such a comparison. We characterize the mass-metallicity trend, finding a
slope consistent between planets measured in transit versus eclipse, but offset
in metallicity. Compared to the Solar System and constraints from interior
modeling, gas giant atmospheres appear to exhibit a steeper mass-metallicity
trend. We hope that the tools available in ExoComp and the data in the Library
of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements can enhance the science
return of the wide-array of space- and ground-based exoplanet science being
undertaken by the community.
