TL;DR: 行星散射模型解释超级地球间距分布：行星盘迁移形成共振链后，少量行星体散射可导致共振偏移或链断裂，解释观测到的共振外超和共振对消失现象。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测发现多行星系统中的超级地球间距分布广泛且基本无特征，但在一些一阶平均运动共振（MMR）附近存在显著超量。需要解释这种共振外超现象以及共振对在特定时间尺度上的消失。

Method: 扩展"打破链"模型，假设超级地球在盘驱动迁移后形成稳定共振链，然后引入仅占系统质量几个百分点的行星体群进行散射。行星体散射通过排斥相邻行星对使其偏离初始MMR来"摇动"共振链。

Result: 行星体散射能以两种方式重组原始共振链：1）一些链保持摇动但基本完整，形成观测到的共振外超；2）其他系统中，初始摇动为后续轨道不稳定埋下种子，最终完全打破共振链。如果单个行星体质量约为冥王星质量，这些不稳定可能在系统形成后数十或数百Myr发生，自然解释了共振对在此时间尺度上的消失。

Conclusion: 少量行星体散射可以解释超级地球间距分布的两个关键特征：共振外超和共振对的时间演化。但冥王星质量碎片的来源目前尚不清楚。

Abstract: The spacings of super-Earths in multi-transiting systems exhibit a distribution that is broad and mostly featureless, with the exception of notable excesses of planet pairs situated a few percent wide of first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this work, we extend the so-called "breaking-the-chains" model to account for both of these characteristics. Assuming that super-Earths are settled into stable chains of resonances after disk-driven migration, we show that scattering a planetesimal population that contains only a few percent of a system's mass can reorganize primordial chains in remarkable ways. The planetesimal scattering "rattles" the chains by repelling adjacent planet pairs wide of their initial MMRs. Some chains remain rattled but otherwise intact and make up the observed excesses wide of MMRs. In other systems, however, this initial rattling sows the seeds of later orbital instabilities that break the chains entirely. If individual planetesimals' masses are of order a Pluto mass or so, the onset of these instabilities can occur tens or hundreds of Myr after birth, naturally explaining the apparent disappearance of near-resonant pairs on this timescale. The origin of such Pluto-mass debris is currently unknown.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释木卫三、木卫四和土卫六等巨型行星卫星异常富水（冰岩比约1:1）的成因，这些卫星的组成特征挑战了传统的卫星形成理论

Method: 使用半解析模型模拟环行星盘中尘埃和水蒸气演化，分析冰线处冰的积累过程，考虑湍流参数（施密特数和α参数）的影响

Result: 冰线处固体物质在几千年内达到稳态冰岩比，比盘内其他区域高数倍，这为富水卫星的形成提供了自然场所

Conclusion: 环行星盘冰线处的冰积累是解释富水卫星组成的一阶过程，同时评估了CO转化为CH4产生水的替代方案

Abstract: The volatile budgets of giant planet satellites are critical to unraveling the origin of their building blocks within the circumplanetary disks that hosted them. The Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as the Saturnian moon Titan, are known to be anomalously water rich on the basis of their mean densities and interior models informed by gravity data from Galileo and Cassini, characterized by ice-to-rock ratios around unity. Here, we show that the water-ice sublimation line in a decreting circumplanetary disk lends itself to the formation of a water-rich solid reservoir, serving as a natural site for the birthplace of icy satellites. Fundamentally, this reflects how interior to the ice line, water vapor is advected outward, while beyond it, water ice drifts inward as pebbles. Using a semi-analytic model for dust and vapor evolution, we simulate vapor and ice accumulation at the ice line, showing that solids just beyond it achieve steady-state ice-to-rock ratios a factor of a few higher than elsewhere in the disk. For typical disk parameters, this ice buildup occurs within a timescale of a few thousand years. We propose this as a first-order process that explains, at least to some extent, the compositions of three aforementioned satellites. We explore the impact of uncertain turbulence parameters on our results, namely the turbulent Schmidt number and Shakura-Sunyaev alpha, before discussing them in the context of icy satellite D/H ratios. We conclude by evaluating alternative scenarios for explaining water-rich satellites, based on the conversion of CO to CH4, with water as a by-product.

TL;DR: HATPI望远镜观测星际彗星3I/ATLAS的光度测量研究，发现其亮度随日心距离的变化比文献报道更陡峭


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用新启用的HATPI宽视场时域巡天设施，对星际彗星3I/ATLAS进行高时间分辨率光度监测，研究其亮度变化特性

Method: 使用HATPI望远镜（64个9.6cm镜头，7100平方度视场，45秒曝光）对3I/ATLAS进行时间序列测光观测，分析亮度随日心距离的变化规律

Result: 成功在发现后第二天（2025年7月2日）探测到彗星（G=17.796±0.082 mag），亮度持续增加到G=14.071±0.073 mag（9月13日）。亮度随日心距离的幂律指数为n=5.167±0.095，比文献综合值n=3.94±0.10更陡峭，相位函数β=0.0552±0.0032 mag deg⁻¹

Conclusion: HATPI设施能够有效监测移动天体的光度变化，星际彗星3I/ATLAS的亮度变化特性与太阳系彗星存在差异，需要进一步研究其物理性质

Abstract: HATPI is a recently commissioned time-domain facility at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, that uses 64 wide-angle, 9.6 cm diameter lenses and back-illuminated CCDs, yielding a mosaic field-of-view of 7,100 square arcdegrees, observing the night sky at a cadence of 45 s and a spatial scale of 19.7 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. In this paper, we present moving object time-series photometry with this facility, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. 3I/ATLAS was first robustly recovered by HATPI on the night of 2025 July 2 (one night after its discovery) at a Gaia $G$-band magnitude of $G = 17.796 \pm 0.082$ mag ($\pm 0.030$ mag systematic uncertainty). The comet then increased in brightness to $G = 14.071 \pm 0.073$ mag $\pm 0.030$ mag by 2025 Sep 13, after which it became unobservable by HATPI as it approached perihelion. Before 3I/ATLAS achieved a brightness of $G = 16.396 \pm 0.029$ mag $\pm 0.030$ mag on 2025 Aug 6, it could be detected when stacking all HATPI observations from a single night, while after this date it is sufficiently bright to detect in individual 45 s exposures. We do not detect evidence for significant short-time-scale variations in the brightness of 3I/ATLAS after Aug 6. Compared to other light curves in the literature, the HATPI photometry exhibits a somewhat steeper rise in brightness with decreasing heliocentric distance, $r_{H}$. The HATPI magnitudes are well-fit as a power law function of $r_{H}$, with an exponential index of $n = 5.167 \pm 0.095$, over the range $2.14$ AU $ < r_{H} < 4.44$ AU, compared to $n = 3.94 \pm 0.10$ when fitting together with other literature observations. We find that the phase function is constrained to $β= 0.0552 \pm 0.0032$ mag deg$^{-1}$.

### [4] [Tidal disruptions of rubble piles: The case of Phobos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21912)
*Harrison Agrusa,Patrick Michel*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究碎石堆卫星（如火卫一）在潮汐作用下向内迁移时的命运，发现低内聚强度卫星会经历表面剥离而非内部破坏，火卫一可能在2火星半径外被摧毁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多太阳系小卫星处于亚同步轨道，因潮汐耗散而轨道衰减。除非有足够材料强度，否则会在到达行星表面前潮汐瓦解。研究碎石堆卫星（特别是火卫一）向内迁移的命运，对理解火星卫星起源演化有重要意义。

Method: 结合解析估计和数值模拟，分析火卫一类似卫星的破坏模式和潮汐瓦解距离，考虑其形状和内聚强度的影响。使用数值模拟验证解析结果。

Result: 发现低内聚强度卫星会经历表面潮汐剥离而非内部破坏。数值模拟显示，若火卫一具有类似近期航天器访问的小天体强度，将在2火星半径外被摧毁。先前研究可能高估了火卫一强度，低估了其潮汐瓦解距离。

Conclusion: 火卫一的最终命运取决于其未知的内部结构和材料特性，JAXA的MMX任务和IDEFIX漫游车将提供关键数据。这些结果对火星卫星起源演化理论及其他不规则形状小卫星的潮汐瓦解有重要意义。

Abstract: Many small satellites in the Solar System have sub-synchronous orbits, meaning their orbits are decaying due to tidal dissipation. Unless they have substantial material strength, they will eventually tidally disrupt before reaching their planet's surface. We studied the fate of rubble-pile satellites as they migrate inward, with a particular focus on the case of Phobos. We used a combination of analytic estimates and numerical simulations to determine the failure mode and tidal disruption distance of a Phobos-like satellite, as a function of its shape and cohesive strength. Both analytically and numerically, we identify a regime for satellites with low cohesive strengths whereby their surface can be tidally stripped without undergoing internal failure. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that Phobos will be destroyed beyond 2 Mars radii if it has a bulk strength similar to those estimated for small bodies recently visited by spacecraft. Based on our results and some additional arguments, we suggest that previous studies on the fate of Phobos have overestimated its strength, and therefore underestimated its tidal disruption distance. We also speculate that if Phobos undergoes some tidal stripping, its ultimate fate may be determined by runaway collisional erosion rather than a pure tidal disruption. However, the ultimate tidal disruption distance for Phobos will depend on its unknown internal structure and bulk material properties, which will be constrained by JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission and its IDEFIX rover. These results have implications for theories about the origin and evolution of the Martian moons and for tidal disruptions of other small, irregularly shaped satellites.

### [5] [Survival of Protoplanetary Disks in Upper Scorpius from Population Synthesis Models with External Photoevaporation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22050)
*Jingyi Ping,Rossella Anania,Paola Pinilla,Miguel Vioque*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究通过粘性演化结合外部光蒸发模型，模拟原行星盘在中等远紫外辐射下的演化，发现该模型能产生3-7 Myr的盘寿命，与观测一致，特别强调了外部光蒸发对盘群演化的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究原行星盘在中等远紫外辐射场下的演化机制，特别是结合粘性演化和外部光蒸发，以解释观测到的盘寿命（约3-7 Myr）和盘群特征。

Method: 采用粘性原行星盘模型结合外部光蒸发，进行群体合成模拟。从初始质量函数中抽取恒星质量，探索不同初始盘条件，跟踪10 Myr演化过程中的气体盘质量和尺寸变化。

Result: 模型预测盘寿命为3-7 Myr，与观测一致。低质量恒星（0.1 M⊙）的盘更易消散，其比例从初始的76%降至10 Myr时的51%。长寿命盘主要具有低粘度（α<10^{-3.5}）和初始特征半径小（R_c<125 AU）的特征。

Conclusion: 即使在中等远紫外辐射水平下，外部光蒸发对原行星盘群体的演化也起着关键作用。粘性演化与外部光蒸发结合能很好地解释观测到的盘寿命和盘群特征。

Abstract: We present population synthesis models of viscous protoplanetary disks subject to mild external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields ($F_{\rm UV}=1\text{-}100\,$G$_0$). Our simulations focus on gas disk evolution, exploring stellar masses drawn from an Initial Mass Function and a range of initial disk conditions. We quantify the fraction of surviving disks across $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, track the evolution of gas disk mass and size, and compare our results with observations of protoplanetary disks in the Upper Scorpius region, including the ten targets studied by the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. We find that models combining viscous evolution with external photoevaporation yield disk lifetimes of $3\text{-}7\,\mathrm{Myr}$, consistent with observed dispersal timescales, particularly for $10^{-4} \leq α\leq 10^{-2}$. Low-mass stars ($0.1\,$M$_\odot$) are more susceptible to disk dispersal due to their weaker gravitational binding, with their fraction among all surviving disks dropping from $76\%$ at birth to $51\%$ by $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The majority of the long-lived disks are those with low viscosity $α< 10^{-3.5}$ and initial characteristic radius $R_c < 125\,\mathrm{AU}$, while the initial disk-to-star mass ratio does not play an important role. The median gas disk mass and radius of the surviving disks exhibit a sharp decline in the first $0.2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, followed by a slight increase that reflects survivorship bias. We also explore correlations between gas disk mass and size vs. stellar mass and FUV strength. Our findings highlight the critical role of external photoevaporation in shaping disk populations even at moderate levels of FUV radiation fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有数十年观测，但太阳系外小天体（系外彗星）的质量损失物理过程仍不清楚。这些系外彗星常被视为太阳系彗星的类似物，但它们所处的恒星环境（光度、恒星风、演化阶段）差异巨大，可能导致非常不同的物理行为。

Method: 综述了驱动小天体质量损失的机制和喷射物演化的理解，比较了驱动气体和尘埃产生的物理化学机制，研究了这些机制如何随恒星光度、温度和活动性变化。然后考察了改变喷射物成分（如尘埃升华、解离、电离）和动力学（如辐射压或恒星风）的过程。使用四个行星系统作为案例研究：太阳、β Pictoris、AU Microscopii和WD 1145+017。

Result: 通过探索彗星尾巴在不同条件下的行为，为解释系外彗星活动提供了物理框架，并阐明了为什么A型恒星（如著名的β Pictoris）在拥有系外彗星的恒星中占比过高。

Conclusion: 该工作系统性地分析了不同恒星环境下小天体质量损失的多样机制，通过对比研究揭示了恒星特性对彗星活动观测特征的关键影响，特别解释了A型恒星中系外彗星观测频率高的物理原因。

Abstract: Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures.
  This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $β$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $β$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.
