Motivation: 海王星沙漠的下边缘被认为是由大气失造成的，但星辉高能量辐射的不确定性会影响流体力学逃逗模型的准确性

Method: 利用Keck/NIRSPEC仪器观测TOI-4010系统中位于不同区域的三个海王星大小行星（b在沙漠，c在脊梅，d在草原）的辅动氪逆光深度，并使用Parker风模型分析数据

Result: 测量到的氪吸收上限分别为1.23%、0.81%、0.87%，对应的大气失速率上限为10^10.17、10^10.53、10^10.50 g/s，这些非检测结果与一维液动力学模型的预测不符

Conclusion: 研究考虑了可能减少信号的多种因素（如主星XUV光度降低、行星磁场、大气金属度增高等），并探讨了这些测量对三个行星过去蒸发历史的含义

Abstract: Photoevaporative models predict that the lower edge of the Neptune desert is
sculpted by atmospheric mass loss. However, the stellar high energy fluxes that
power hydrodynamic escape and set predicted mass loss rates can be uncertain by
multiple orders of magnitude. These uncertainties can be bypassed by studying
mass loss for planets within the same system, as they have effectively
undergone scaled versions of the same irradiation history. The TOI-4010 system
is an ideal test case for mass loss models, as it contains three Neptune-sized
planets with planet b located in the `Neptune desert', planet c in the `Neptune
ridge', and planet d in the `Neptune savanna'. Using Keck/NIRSPEC, we measured
the metastable helium transit depths of all three planets in order to search
for evidence of atmospheric escape. We place upper bounds on the excess helium
absorption of 1.23\%, 0.81\%, and 0.87\% at 95\% confidence for TOI-4010~b, c
and d respectively. We fit our transmission spectra with Parker wind models and
find that this corresponds to 95th-percentile upper limits of
$10^{10.17}$g~s$^{-1}$, $10^{10.53}$g~s$^{-1}$, and $10^{10.50}$g~s$^{-1}$ on
the mass loss rates of TOI-4010~b, c, and d respectively. Our non-detections
are inconsistent with expectations from one-dimensional hydrodynamic models for
solar composition atmospheres. We consider potential reductions in signal from
a decreased host star XUV luminosity, planetary magnetic fields, enhanced
atmospheric metallicities, and fractionation, and explore the implications of
our measurements for the past evaporation histories of all three planets.

TL;DR: TESS发现TOI-1438多行星系统，包含两颗亚海王星大小的内行星和一颗可能存在的长周期巨行星，但第三颗行星信号可能来自恒星活动需要进一步确认


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测和表征系外行星系统，特别是具有特殊架构的多行星系统，有助于理解行星形成和演化机制

Method: 使用TESS数据发现行星，通过HARPS-N进行5年高分辨率光谱观测获得径向速度数据，建立行星内部结构模型进行分析

Result: 确认两颗亚海王星：行星b（3.04±0.19地球半径，9.4±1.8地球质量）和行星c（2.75±0.14地球半径，10.6±2.1地球质量），轨道周期分别为5.1天和9.4天；发现第三个可能的长周期行星信号（周期约7.6年，最小质量2.1±0.3木星质量）

Conclusion: TOI-1438系统可能具有两颗短周期小行星和一颗长周期巨行星的特殊架构，但第三颗行星信号需要更多观测确认是否为真实行星而非恒星活动

Abstract: We present the detection and characterisation of the TOI-1438 multi-planet
system discovered by TESS. We collected a series of follow-up observations
including high-spectral resolution observations with HARPS-N over a period of
five years. Our modelling shows that the K0V star hosts two transiting
sub-Neptunes with Rb = 3.04 +/- 0.19 RE, Rc = 2.75 +/- 0.14 RE, Mb = 9.4 +/-
1.8 ME, and Mc = 10.6 +/- 2.1 ME. The orbital periods of planets b and c are
5.1 and 9.4 days, respectively, corresponding to instellations of 145 +/- 10
and 65 +/- 4 FE. The bulk densities are 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 g cm-3,
respectively, suggesting a volatile-rich interior composition. We computed a
set of planet interior structure models. Planet b presents a high-metallicity
envelope that can accommodate up to 2.5 % in H/He in mass, while planet c
cannot have more than 0.2 % as H/He in mass. For any composition of the core
considered (Fe-rock or ice-rock), both planets would require a volatile-rich
envelope. In addition to the two planets, the radial velocity (RV) data clearly
reveal a third signal, likely coming from a non-transiting planet, with an
orbital period of 7.6 +1.6 -2.4 years and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of
35+3-5 m s-1. Our best fit model finds a minimum mass of 2.1 +/- 0.3 MJ and an
eccentricity of 0.25+0.08-0.11. However, several RV activity indicators also
show strong signals at similar periods, suggesting this signal might (partly)
originate from stellar activity. More data over a longer period of time are
needed to conclusively determine the nature of this signal. If it is confirmed
as a triple-planet system, TOI-1438 would be one of the few detected systems to
date characterised by an architecture with two small, short-period planets and
one massive, long-period planet, where the inner and outer systems are
separated by an orbital period ratio of the order of a few hundred.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了M型矮星周围超级地球发生率更高的原因，发现粘滞加热导致行星向外迁移，减少了高质量恒星周围的内部超级地球数量，增加了巨行星数量，这与观测结果一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解超级地球种群如何受恒星质量、原行星盘大小和粘滞加热的影响，解释M型矮星周围超级地球发生率更高的观测现象。

Method: 使用包含辐射加热和粘滞加热的标准原行星盘模型，结合卵石吸积模型，模拟行星的形成和迁移过程。

Result: 纯辐射加热时，超级地球向内迁移效率高，随恒星质量增加而增加；加入粘滞加热后，行星可向外迁移，减少高质量恒星周围的内部超级地球，增加巨行星数量。

Conclusion: 粘滞加热是解释行星种群观测特征的关键因素，特别是对于大尺寸原行星盘，这种效应最为明显。

Abstract: The occurrence rate of close-in super-Earths is higher around M-dwarfs
compared to stars of higher masses. In this work we aim to understand how the
super-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the
protoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary
disc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble
accretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find
that if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards
migration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in
super-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when
viscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying
migration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction
of super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in
a significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an
increase in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features
of the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced
when the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer
time-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time
early on in the disc lifetime. In this case, the fraction of close-in
super-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass in both the irradiated case
and viscous case, since longer disc lifetimes around high-mass stars allows for
planets to grow into giants instead of super-Earths for most injection
locations.

### [4] [The Impact of Enhanced EUV Flux on the Upper Atmosphere of Earth-like Exoplanets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21745)
*Lukas Hanson,Ofer Cohen,Aaron Ridley,Alex Glocer*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用GITM模型研究增强EUV通量对类地系外行星大气稳定性的影响，发现EUV通量超过基线10倍时大气会快速逃逸，一维模型无法准确捕捉全球大气非均匀性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别类地系外行星并确定其大气稳定性是天文学重要目标，但目前仍难以评估行星是否拥有并能保持大气层

Method: 使用全球电离层和热层模型(GITM)，以地球EUV通量为基线，研究通量增强至50倍的影响，比较一维和三维解决方案

Result: 增强EUV通量导致电离层膨胀和升高，在EUV通量达到基线10倍时出现大气稳定性阈值，超过此阈值大气快速逃逸，相当于行星距离恒星约0.3AU

Conclusion: 类地系外行星若在靠近恒星的轨道运行，很可能快速失去大气层，一维模型在捕捉全球大气非均匀性方面存在局限

Abstract: Identifying Earth-like planets outside out solar system is a leading research
goal in astronomy, but determining if candidate planets have atmospheres, and
more importantly if they can retain atmospheres, is still out of reach. In this
paper, we present our study on the impact of enhanced EUV flux on the stability
and escape of the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global
Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model (GITM). We also investigate the differences
between one- and three-dimensional solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV
flux experienced at the Earth, and multiplying this flux by a constant factor
going up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and elevated
ionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a detailed picture of how
different heating and cooling rates, as well as the conductivity are changing
at each EUV flux level. Our results also demonstrate that one-dimensional
solutions are limited in their ability to capture a global atmosphere that are
not uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux level for a stable atmosphere
occurs around a factor of 10 times the baseline level, where EUV fluxes above
this level indicate a rapidly escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux
translates to about 0.3AU for a planet orbiting the Sun. Thus, our findings
indicate that an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting its host star in a close-in
orbit is likely to lose its atmosphere quickly.
