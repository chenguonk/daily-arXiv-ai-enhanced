Recent research has determined the existence of AGB\n``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through\nstar-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to\nWR winds and supernovae.

Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and\nWeywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution\ntheory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day\narchitecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions\nrequired. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two\nformalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT)\nframework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on\nWeywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital\ndistances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal\ntorques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin,\nhowever, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period\nbased on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value.\nA match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates\nand if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are\ninconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense\nsatellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most\nplausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated\ndwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated\nwarm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis\nbut cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an\nunrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that\nnon-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss,\nor a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's\nrotational evolution."}

Recent observations of the d203-504\ndisc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external\nphotoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In\nparticular, having the combination of accretion rate and external\nphotoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we\nrun a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can\nmatch the observed values.

We simulated sub-escape-velocity mergers\nbetween moonlets and studied the resulting structural evolution of the formed\nmoon in a tidal environment using the polyhedral discrete elements method\nN-body code GRAINS. Firstly, we find that the shapes of rubble-pile moons\nformed by mergers in this regime are highly dependent on the shape and initial\norientation of the involved moonlets.

Secondly, we\nobserve that mass-loss via tidal disruption for a bilobate object occurs in\ndiscrete regimes of distance to the primary. Closer to the primary, the\ninnermost lobe is completely stripped off, while only a small piece of it is\nlost further out.

If universal, this connection could affect the formation and\nevolution of all planets. Therefore, this potential vital link needs testing by\ncharacterising exoplanets around chemically-diverse stars. We present the\ndiscovery of two planets orbiting the metal-poor, kinematic thick-disk K-dwarf\nTOI-2345. TOI-2345 b is a super-Earth with a period of 1.05 days and TOI-2345 c\nis a sub-Neptune with a period of 21 days. In addition to the target being\nobserved in 4 TESS sectors, we obtained 5 CHEOPS visits and 26 radial\nvelocities from HARPS. By conducting a joint analysis of all the data, we find\nTOI-2345 b to have a radius of $1.504\\substack{+0.047\\\\-0.044}$ R$_\\oplus$ and\na mass of $3.49\\pm0.85$ M$_\\oplus$; and TOI-2345 c to have a radius of\n$2.451\\substack{+0.045\\\\-0.046}$ R$_\\oplus$ and a mass of\n$7.27\\substack{+2.27\\\\-2.45}$ M$_\\oplus$. To explore chemical links between\nthese planets and their host star, we model their interior structures newly\naccounting for devolatised stellar abundances. TOI-2345 adds to the limited\nsample of well characterised planetary systems around thick disk stars. This\nsystem challenges theories of formation and populations of planets around thick\ndisk stars with its Ultra-Short Period super-Earth and the wide period\ndistribution of these two planets spanning the radius valley."}

A Palette of Water Growth Histories in TRAPPIST-1 Analogs and Compact Planetary Systems", "comment": "21 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, published in the Astrophysical Journal\n  Letters", "summary": "It is still unclear whether exoplanets in compact multiplanet systems such as\nTRAPPIST-1 are able to accrete large quantities of volatiles, grow to\nsufficient mass, and maintain robust atmospheres and hydrospheres. Previous\nestimates of water content in M-dwarf systems have largely relied on population\nsynthesis or atmosphere-interior evolution models, often treating impacts and\natmospheric loss in isolation. In this work, we couple impact delivery, impact\nerosion, and mantle-atmosphere exchange within a model that tracks volatile\nevolution through stochastic collision histories. By explicitly including both\nplanetesimal accretion and the prolonged luminous pre-main-sequence phase of M\ndwarfs, we find lower water inventories for the inner TRAPPIST-1 analogs (b-e),\nspanning only $10^{-4}$-$10^{-2} M_{\\oplus,\\rm ocn}$ across a wide range of\ndisk structures and impact scenarios. By contrast, the outer planets (f-h\nanalogs) frequently retain water inventories exceeding an Earth ocean mass.\nThis systematic volatile gradient provides a physically motivated explanation\nfor JWST's nondetections of atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b and c, implying an\norigin rooted in formation conditions rather than in post-formation escape. Our\nresults suggest that many rocky planets in compact M-dwarf systems may form\nalready depleted in volatile compounds, fundamentally limiting their capacity\nto sustain atmospheres or surface oceans. More broadly, our multistage\nframework for volatile tracking can help interpret future observations of\ncompact systems and set more realistic initial conditions for exoplanet\ninterior compositions and atmospheric models."}
