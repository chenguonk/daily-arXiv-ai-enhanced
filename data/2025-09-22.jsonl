Aims: Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a moon search\nbased on astrometric time series data, repeated measurements of the position of\na given planet relative to its host star. The perturbing influence of an\norbiting moon induces a potentially detectable planetary reflex motion.\nMethods: Based on an analytical description of the astrometric signal\namplitude, we place the expected signatures of putative moons around real\nexoplanets into context with our current and future astrometric measurement\nprecision. Modelling the orbital perturbation as a function of time, we then\nsimulate the detection process to obtain the first astrometric exomoon\nsensitivity curves. Results: The astrometric technique already allows for the\ndetection and characterisation of favourable moons around giant exoplanets and\nbrown dwarfs. On the basis of 12 epochs obtained with VLTI/GRAVITY, it is\nalready today possible to infer the presence of a 0.14\n$\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{Jup}$ satellite at a separation of 0.39 AU around AF Lep b.\nFuture facilities offering better precision will refine our sensitivity in both\nmoon mass and separation from the host planet by several orders of magnitude.\nConclusions: The astrometric method of exomoon detection provides a promising\navenue towards making the detection of these elusive worlds a reality and\nefficiently building a sample of confirmed objects. With a future facility that\nachieves an astrometric precision of 1 mas, probing for Earth-like moons within\nthe habitable zone of a given star will become a realistic proposition."}

We robustly detect ionised calcium (Ca+), and find\nevidence for hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), neutral calcium (Ca),\ntitanium (Ti), ionised titanium (Ti+), ionised iron (Fe+), neutral iron (Fe),\nand ionised strontium (Sr+). The strongest detection was achieved in the red\narm of Veloce, consistent with expectations due to the prominent Ca+ triplet at\nwavelengths around 850-870 nm. Our results validate Veloce's capability for\nhigh-resolution atmospheric studies, highlighting it as an accessible, flexible\nfacility to complement larger international telescopes.

The disks are classified\ninto less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared\nspectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a\nrelatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity,\nand are dominated by 5 $\\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker\nsilicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass\nfractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate\nemission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas\ncolumn density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas\nis exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings\nmay reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal\nprocessing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These\nresults highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between\ndust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form."}

High internal temperatures from giant\nimpacts can provide sufficient energy to drive extreme volatile loss, with\nhydrogen being most readily lost. However, the conditions required for\nmaintaining a primordial atmosphere over geological timescales remain\nenigmatic. This paper revisits the core powered mass loss model for hydrogen\nremoval from planetary atmospheres. One popular approach is to combine mass\ncontinuity at the sonic point with an energy-based constraint. We demonstrate\nthat the so-called ``energy limited'' component of this model is unnecessary\nbecause atmospheric loss following giant impacts is governed solely by\nconditions at the sonic point. By simulating a broad range of synthetic\nexoplanets, varying in planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and\ntemperature, we find that the ``energy limited'' model can underestimate the\nmass loss rates by up to eight orders of magnitude. Our findings suggest that,\nfor sufficiently hot post-impact surface conditions, hydrogen rich atmospheres\ncan be removed on dynamical timescales that are far shorter than one million\nyears."}

We detect water vapor (ln\nB = 4.1), carbon dioxide (ln B = 85.6), and sulfur dioxide (ln B = 13.5) with\nhigh confidence, along with marginal indications for hydrogen sulfide and\ncarbon monoxide (ln B < 0.5). The detection of SO2 in a warm super-Neptune\nsized exoplanet (radius about 6 Earth radii) bridges the gap between previous\ndetections in hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, highlighting the role of\ndisequilibrium photochemistry across a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres,\nincluding those cooler than 1000 K. Our precise measurements of carbon, oxygen,\nand sulfur indicate an atmospheric metallicity of about 10 times solar and a\nsub-solar C/O ratio. Retrieved molecular abundances are consistent within 2\nsigma with predictions from self-consistent models including photochemistry.\nThe elevated CO2 abundance and possible H2S signal may also reflect\nsensitivities to the thermal structure, cloud properties, or additional\ndisequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing. We compare the SO2 abundance\nin HAT-P-26 b with that of ten other JWST-observed giant exoplanets, and find a\ncorrelation with atmospheric metallicity. The trend is consistent with the\nprediction from Crossfield (2023), showing a steep rise in SO2 abundance at low\nmetallicities, and a more gradual increase beyond 30 times solar. This work is\npart of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in\nwhich we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of\nExoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS)."}

Exploring the properties and origin\nof this gas could be fundamental to better understanding the transition between\nthe protoplanetary and debris disk phases, the evolution of icy planetesimal\nbelts, and the formation of planetary atmospheres. To expand the list of known\nCO-bearing debris disks and to improve our knowledge of the environmental\nconditions under which they can form, we targeted twelve dust-rich debris disks\naround young ($<$50 Myr) intermediate-mass stars. Using the ALMA 12-m Array we\nperformed millimeter continuum and CO line observations to search for dust and\ngas and to measure their quantity and spatial distribution. We discovered CO\ngas in five disks. Two of them have a low CO content of a few times 10$^{-5}$\nM$_\\oplus$, similar to that of $\\beta$ Pic. The other three disks, however, are\nCO-rich with $M_\\mathrm{CO}>10^{-3}$ M$_\\oplus$. By combining our results with\nthose of other studies we concluded, in agreement with previous findings, that\nthe detection rate of CO gas is significantly higher for disks around stars\nwith $6.5~L_\\odot<L_*<21.9~L_\\odot$ ($\\sim$A8$-$A0 spectral type) than for\ndisks around less luminous stars ($0.18~L_\\odot<L_*<6.4~L_\\odot$, K7$-$A9). A\ncomparison of the measured CO masses and the estimated mass loss rates of\nsolids in disks with low CO content ($<$10$^{-4}$ M$_\\oplus$) suggests that\ncollisions may play a role in CO gas production in such systems. Interestingly,\nhowever, the estimated mass loss rates of CO-rich debris disks are not higher\nthan those of systems with low CO content. In light of this finding, we\nspeculate on what could lead to the formation of CO-rich debris disks."}

Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets\nrequire accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies\nin binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet\ndetections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential\nself-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the\neffect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series\nof typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic\nplanet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S\nmodel search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey\nstatistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary\nsensitivity by $5\\sim10\\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host\nmass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates\nand a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be\ncritical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth\n2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We\nalso discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for\nfuture applications."}
