We investigate how the radius valley depends on stellar type by\nanalyzing an updated, transit-only sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet\nArchive. Planets are selected with $P < 100$ days and divided by host spectral\nclass (M, K, G, F). We construct weighted radius distributions and apply\nstatistical tests to quantify the valley depth. We recover a pronounced valley\ncentered near $\\sim 1.8\\,R_\\oplus$ for G/K stars, but shifted to $\\sim\n1.6\\,R_\\oplus$ for M dwarfs and $\\sim 1.9\\,R_\\oplus$ for F stars. These results\nsupport the view that the radius valley is shaped by stellar-dependent\nprocesses such as photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and orbital\nmigration."}

Estimates of its age and mass\nvary, fueling a decade-long debate. Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K,\nlog(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and\nheterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using\nmid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR\nmeasurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in\nage and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C,\nF1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar\nmodel. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species\n(CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to\nisochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy\ndistribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to\nconstrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere\nmodels fit best, consistent with the L0/L2 spectral type and position near\nsilicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7\nMyr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling\nyielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by\n30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous\nbest value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the\ndeuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the\nColumba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring\nspectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and\ntemperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving\nthe overall characterization of kAndb."}

Here, we expand upon previous\nefforts to quantify element volatility during disk condensation, and how this\naffects rocky planet compositional diversity.\n  We simulate condensation sequences for a sample of 1000 initial disk\ncompositions based on observed stellar abundances. We present parametrisations\nof how element 50% condensation temperatures depend on disk composition, and\napply element fractionation trends with appropriate element volatilty to\nstellar abundances to simulate compositions of rocky exoplanets with the same\nvolatile depletion pattern as the Earth, providing a robust and conservative\nlower limit to the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets.\n  Here we show that Earth-like planets emerge from low-C-to-O disks and\ngraphite-bearing planets from medium-to-high-C-to-O disks. Furthermore, we\nidentify an intermediate-C-to-O class of planets characterized by Mg and Si\ndepletion, leading to relatively high abundances of Fe, Ca, and Al. We show\nthat devolatilisation patterns could be adapted potentially with disk\ncomposition-dependent condensation temperatures to make predictions of rocky\nplanet bulk compositions within individual systems. The outcomes of our\nanalysis suggest that accounting for disk composition-dependent condensation\ntemperatures means that we can expect an even broader range of possible rocky\nplanet compositions than has previously been considered."}

Their structural, kinematic, and chemical similarities to\nplanet-forming discs have motivated the idea that these systems may act as\nsites of \"second-generation\" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether\nthe gravitational instability mechanism - a proposed pathway for giant planet\nformation in some protoplanetary discs-can operate in post-AGB discs. Using the\nToomre criterion under well-motivated assumptions for disc structure and size,\nmass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational\ninstability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using several\nwell-studied protoplanetary disc systems before applying the same analysis to\nobserved post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally\ngravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. The disks\nwere stable against collapse, even when accounting for potentially higher disk\nmass in the past. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the\nsame way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases\nearly on. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the\npost-common envelope system NN Serpentis first carried out by Schleicher and\nDreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under\nspecific, high disc mass assumptions, however we note that their proposed disc\nmass is unlikely. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical\nassessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that\nthis mechanism is unlikely to dominate second-generation planet formation in\nthese systems, and underscoring the need to explore alternative pathways-such\nas core accretion-in future studies"}

The model covers\natmospheric pressure range from $1.1 \\times 10^{3}$ bar to $7.4 \\times\n10^{-11}$ bar and is the first model that incorporates sulfur chemistry when\nspanning an atmospheric region of this extent. This model incorporates a new\nversion of the STAND reaction network with updated NH4SH chemistry, and updated\nAntoine equation parameters for NH4SH and H2S. Validation against current\nmodels of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as recent observational data shows that\nour model successfully describes Jupiter's main observed chemical features.\nSince one of the focuses of the model is the chemistry on nitrogen, it\ncorrectly predicts the formation of a mixed NH3-NH4SH cloud layer between 0.1\nand 1 bar. It also describes the chemistry of HCN throughout the atmosphere and\ndiscovers a region in the stratosphere between $1 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $6.76\n\\times 10^{-8}$ bar, where HCN forms through radical chemistry with maximum\nmixing ratio 33 ppb at $2.94 \\times 10^{-7}$ bar -- a prediction testable by\nobservations.

During science phases, when radiometric tracking is sparse and low\nillumination limits conventional optical navigation methods, occultation\nevents, defined as precise timings of stellar appearances/disappearances behind\nthe Moon's limb, offer a suitable alternative. A simulation tool based on JPL's\nMONTE library was developed to identify valid occultation events, applying\ngeometric and illumination constraints to exclude non-observable cases. These\nevents were integrated into a batch least-squares orbit determination filter\nalongside conventional radiometric data. The covariance analysis shows that\noccultation observables reduce the transverse and normal position uncertainties\nof LUMIO by up to a factor of two, especially during tracking gaps or\noccultation-rich arcs. This uncertainty reduction is expected to facilitate\nstation-keeping operations and constrain the surface localization of Lunar\nImpact Flashes (LIFs), enhancing the mission's scientific return. Sensitivity\nanalyses confirm that the orbit determination performance is primarily driven\nby the timing accuracy of occultation events, with limited dependence on lunar\nshape uncertainty below 100 m. These findings confirm the potential of\noccultation-based navigation to enhance spacecraft autonomy and robustness in\nlow-visibility environments, making it a valuable complement to radiometric\ntechniques for future lunar and deep-space missions."}

The overall\nmorphology of planet--disc interactions has ben shown to be similar in both 2D\nand 3D simulations, however, the ability of a 2D simulation to quantitatively\nmatch 3D results depends strongly on how the potential of the planet is\nhandled. Typically, the 2D planetary potential is smoothed out using some\n`smoothing length', a free parameter, for which different values have been\nproposed, depending on the particular aspect of the interaction focused on. In\nthis paper, we re-derive 2D Navier--Stokes in detail for planet--disc\ninteractions to find better ways to represent the 2D gravitational force. We\nperform a large suite of 2D and 3D simulations to test these force\nprescriptions. We identify the parts of the interaction that are fundamentally\n3D, and test how well our new force prescriptions, as well as traditional\nsmoothed potentials, are able to match 3D simulations. Overall, we find that\nthe optimal way to represent the planetary potential is the `Bessel-type\npotential', but that even in this case 2D simulations are unable to reproduce\nthe correct scaling of the total torque with background gradients, and are at\nbest able match the one-sided Lindblad torque and gap widths to level of 10 per\ncent. We find that analysis of observed gap structures based on standard 2D\nsimulations may systematically underestimate planetary masses by a factor of\ntwo, and discuss the impacts of 3D effects on observations of velocity kinks."}
