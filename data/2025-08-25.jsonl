Despite the importance of host star mass, radius, and\nelemental abundance inferences for the derivation of exoplanet internal\nstructure constraints, published constraints have often been based on\ninferences that are not self-consistent. For 24 dwarf stars hosting terrestrial\nexoplanets, we use astrometric and photometric data plus high-resolution\nspectroscopy to infer accurate, precise, homogeneous, and physically\nself-consistent photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters as well as\nelemental abundances. We infer updated planetary masses and radii using these\ndata plus Doppler and transit observables, then use the complete data set to\nderive constraints on the core-mass fractions of these terrestrial exoplanets.\nWe find that the population of resonant or likely formerly resonant terrestrial\nexoplanets represented by Kepler-36 b and Kepler-105 c has a significantly\nlower mean core-mass fraction than the rest of the terrestrial exoplanets in\nour sample. Their resonant configurations suggest that they migrated inwards\nfrom more distant formation locations, and we attribute their low densities to\nthe incorporation and retention of significant amounts of water during their\nformation. We confirm that the ultra-short-period exoplanets 55 Cnc e and\nWASP-47 e have densities inconsistent with pure-rock compositions. We propose\nthat they are both the stripped cores of mini-Neptunes and associate their low\ndensities with the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen, helium, water,\nand/or other volatiles in their interiors. We verify that our results are\nindependent of stellar parameter and elemental abundance inference approach and\ntherefore robust."}

Constraints on the system's spin and orbit\ncharacteristics were recently used to argue for a dissipative Eris, requiring a\ndifferentiated structure but not necessarily a subsurface ocean. Here, we model\nthe thermal history of Eris coupled to its spin-orbital evolution, finding a\nsubsurface ocean is preferred in order for Eris to be sufficiently dissipative.\nSpinning down Eris without an ocean is difficult, requiring a warm convecting\nice shell protected by a thick insulating layer and very dissipative anelastic\nbehavior in ice. Oceans make up 77-100% of successful thermal-orbital evolution\nmodels, depending on the parameters assumed, which increases to >98% when the\nAndrade $\\beta$ parameter for ice is restricted to $\\beta\\leq3\\times10^{-11}$\nPa$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.25}$. Oceans freeze over by the present day unless insulation\n(porosity, gas clathrates) or antifreeze are present."}
