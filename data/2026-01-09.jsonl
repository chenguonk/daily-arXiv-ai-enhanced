In this paper, we implement the coupled evolution of these modes with the body's orbit in the \\texttt{REBOUNDx} framework, an extension to the popular $N$-body integrator \\texttt{REBOUND}. We provide a variety of test cases relevant to exoplanet dynamics and demonstrate overall agreement with prior studies of dynamical tides in the secular regime. Our implementation is readily applied to various high-eccentricity scenarios and allows for fast and accurate $N$-body investigations of astrophysical systems for which dynamical tides are relevant."}

Capstone project from the Propagation Winter School of Astronomy & Astrophysics 2025. Uses TESS photometry to model transits of WASP-12 b and refine its orbital ephemeris via transit timing analysis", "summary": "We present a detailed transit photometric analysis of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12 b using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system's geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b."}

Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $α$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $α$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $α$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars."}

Richardson", "Harrison Agrusa", "Ryota Nakano"], "title": "A change of the rotation period of asteroid (65803) Didymos caused by the DART impact", "comment": null, "summary": "On 26 September 2022, the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the secondary component of the binary asteroid (65803)~Didymos. This experiment tested the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. Due to the impact, the binary system's angular momentum has changed, resulting in a significant change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. Precise values of the pre- and post-impact orbital periods were derived from a large set of photometric light curves measured for the Didymos-Dimorphos system during six apparitions from 2003 to 2023. We used these data to detect a possible change in the rotation period of the primary as a consequence of the impact. We analyzed the binary system's light curves using the binary asteroid light curve decomposition method. We selected parts of the light curves covering orbital phases outside mutual events, which represent the primary rotational light curves. We applied the light curve inversion method to construct a convex shape model of Didymos and determine its rotation period before and after the impact. These two periods were treated as independent free parameters of the modeling. We found a value of 2.2603891 +/- 0.0000002 h for the pre-impact period and 2.260440 +/- 0.000008 h for the post-impact period. Their difference 0.18 +/- 0.03 s is small yet significant, indicating that the rotation of Didymos became slower after the DART impact. The most plausible physical explanation is Didymos's post-impact reshaping, making its shape more oblate."}

Detecting and Mapping CO", "comment": null, "summary": "The origin of carbon monoxide (CO) in Saturn's stratosphere remains uncertain, with proposed sources including internal thermochemical production, cometary impacts, and exogenic material from the rings and icy moons (i.e. Enceladus). We aim to constrain the vertical and meridional distribution of stratospheric CO and assess the relative contributions of these potential sources. Here, we analysed high-spectral-resolution ALMA observations of the CO (J=3-2) line obtained on 25 May 2018, sampling Saturn's limb from 20°S to 69°N. CO vertical profiles were retrieved using a line-by-line radiative transfer model combined with spectral inversion techniques, testing multiple prior scenarios representative of different source hypotheses. CO is confined to a narrow layer between 0.1 and 1 mbar, with a robust negative vertical gradient and mean abundances of (3.7+/- 0.8) x 10$^{-8}$ at 0.1 mbar and (7.2 +/- 0.9) x 10$^{-8}$ at 1 mbar. The meridional distribution is statistically homogeneous, with a marginal enhancement near 60° N plausibly related to Enceladus. No significant equatorial enhancement is detected. The absence of a strong equatorial enhancement rules out a long-lived steady source associated with ring infall. The observations are most consistent with a relatively recent ($\\approx$200-year-old or younger) cometary impact whose material has since been horizontally mixed, while any Cassini Grand Finale ring influx was either too recent or inefficient to affect CO abundances at the probed pressure levels."}
