We describe and release an open dataset of one million numerically propagated cislunar trajectories generated with the open-source Space Situational Awareness Python package (SSAPy). The model includes high-degree Earth/Moon gravity, solar gravity, and Earth/Sun radiation pressure; other planetary gravities are omitted by design for computational efficiency. Initial conditions uniformly sample commonly used osculating-element ranges, and each trajectory is propagated for up to six years under a single, fixed start epoch. The dataset is intended as a reusable benchmark for method development (e.g., space domain awareness, navigation, and machine learning pipelines), a reference library for statistical studies of orbit families, and a starting point for community-driven extensions (e.g., alternative epochs). We report empirically observed stability trends (e.g., a band near 5 GEO and persistence of some co-orbital classes including L4/L5 librators) as dataset descriptors rather than new dynamical results. The chief contribution is the scale, fidelity, organization (CSV/HDF5 with full state time series and metadata), and open availability, which together lower the barrier to comparative and data-driven studies in the cislunar regime."}

Tackley"], "title": "Mantle Differentiation, Mixing and Interior-Exterior Exchange", "comment": null, "summary": "We review the formation of large-scale heterogeneity in the solid Earth from the magma ocean phase to the present day, focusing on lower-mantle structure and evolution, as well as continental formation and its impact on interior-exterior volatile exchange. The solidification of the magma ocean sets the \"initial condition\" for solid-state mantle structure and evolution, partitioning volatiles between the surface and interior, and differentiating major and trace elements between mantle reservoirs. A possibly long-lived basal magma ocean is a potential reservoir for iron and incompatible trace elements with important implications for the present-day structure of the lowermost mantle and the distribution of heat-producing elements. With emergent plate tectonics and mantle convection, the production of oceanic crust is the dominant differentiation mechanism, and may contribute to lower-mantle heterogeneity. In turn, convection acts to re-mix heterogeneity. Thus, the structure of the lower mantle records the early differentiation of our planet, as well as long-term evolution. The formation of continental crust and lithosphere has also an important influence on deep-mantle structure and composition, because the distribution of continents can control the scale of plate tectonics, and thus affect mantle convection patterns. While the formation of continental crust and lithosphere, scenarios can be tested by self-consistent long-term evolution models. The exchange of water between the surface and mantle also plays an important role in the dynamics of Earth\\' s deep interior. By using relative sea-level change as a proxy for the interior-exterior exchange of water, it is possible to constrain the deep-mantle water cycle. Based on a comprehensive review of these topics, we conclude with several open questions that should be addressed by future studies."}

The same surveys also discover many asteroids that have distant JFC-like orbits, but with no reported activity. We observed asteroids on Jupiter-crossing orbits beyond the depth of typical survey imaging using the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope. We used deep imaging to observe 16 asteroids in this region, plus 7 known comets for comparison. Three asteroids (2011 WM183, (669525) 2012 XO144, and 2020 RX133) showed surface brightness profiles consistent with low-level activity, equating to ~19% of our total sample. We note that 2020 RX133 is a Jupiter Trojan. When we considered the heliocentric distance range of the asteroids at the time they showed activity, this fraction increased to 33% of the targets in the 3.16 \\leq Rh \\leq 4.56 au region, and therefore it is possible to infer that at least ~30 asteroids with Tj \\leq 3.05 and in the 4.05 < a < 5.05 au parameter space may potentially exhibit low-level activity. We also estimated nuclear radii for the three active targets of r_n = 1.8 \\pm 0.2 km, r_n \\leq 0.8 km, and r_n \\leq 0.5 km for (669525) 2012 XO144, 2011 WM183, and 2020 RX133 respectively. The median color index for the observed asteroids is (g-r)_{PS1} = 0.52 \\pm 0.13, aligning with those expected for D-type asteroids."}

The core scientific objective of CPI-C is to conduct high-contrast directly imaging surveys of exoplanets ranging in size from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like, located at separations of 0.5 to 5 AU from their host stars, and to perform systematic spectroscopic analysis of the detected planets through high-precision multi-band photometry. CPI-C employs a step-transmission apodization technique to suppress the diffraction noises from the telescope pupil and a precise phase correction technique to eliminate the speckle noises due to imperfections of the optical surfaces. The contrast requirement is better than $10^{-8}$ at an inner working angle (IWA) of $3-4λ/D$, in the visible wavelength from 600 nm to 900 nm. CPI-C will be the first space-based instrument capable of directly imaging the reflection light from the cool exoplanets in the visible wavelength enabling the measurement of key physical parameters such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, mass, and other key parameters. The potential observation results will significantly contribute to further understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of planets, which will also lay a solid foundation for future confirmation of the Earth-twins in the next generation space flagship missions."}

The long-term evolution of free-floating comets", "comment": "15 pages, 31 figures, accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Context. Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population"}
