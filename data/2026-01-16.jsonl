Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Secular perturbations from binary stars and distant massive planets can drive cold planets onto nearly parabolic orbits with pericenter passages extremely close to their host stars. Meanwhile, short-period super-Earths are frequently observed around nearby stars. Gravitational scattering between these two distinct populations can lead to substantial orbital energy exchange, liberating some intruders from the gravitational confinement of their host systems. This process offers a robust formation channel for a subset of the abundant freely floating planet population. It may also significantly perturb the original orbits of close-in planets, induce collisional trajectories between close-in planets and their host stars, and disrupt the dynamical evolution of cold planets toward close stellar encounters."}

It is unclear how the different disc properties influence the composition of forming giant planets. The idea that the atmospheric abundances can trace directly the formation location of planets is put into question, due to the chemical evolution of the disc, caused by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. This complicates the idea of a relation between atmospheric abundances and planet formation locations. We use planet formation simulations that include the effects of pebble drift and evaporation and investigate how the different disc parameters influence the atmospheric composition of giant planets. We focus on the atmospheric C/O, C/H, O/H and S/H ratios allowing us to probe tracers for volatiles and refractories and thus different accretion pathways of giant planets. We find that most of the disc parameters have only a limited influence on the atmospheric abundances of gas giants, except for the dust-to-gas ratio, where a larger value results in higher atmospheric abundances. However the atmospheric abundances are determined by the planetary formation location, even in the pebble drift and evaporation scenario. Our study suggests that volatile-rich giant exoplanets predominantly form in the inner disc regions, where they can accrete large fractions of vapour-enhanced gas. Our study shows that simulations that try to trace the origin of giant planets via their atmospheric abundances do not have to probe all disc parameters, as long as the disc parameters allow the formation of giant planets. Our study thus suggests that the diversity of observed planetary compositions is a direct consequence of their formation location and migration history."}

As part of the KESPRINT collaboration, we selected the TESS transiting planet candidate TOI-3862.01 for radial velocity follow-up to confirm its planetary nature and characterize its mass and bulk properties. This planet candidate is of particular interest due to its position in the middle of the hot Neptune desert, making it a valuable probe for testing theories of planet migration and atmospheric loss. We confirmed the planetary nature and determined the mass of TOI-3862.01 (hereinafter TOI-3862b) by performing a joint fit with both transit and radial velocity data, precisely characterizing the bulk properties of this planet. TOI-3862b is a super-Neptune on a 1.56-day orbit around a Sun-like star with an effective temperature of 5300$\\pm$50K. It has a mass of 53.7$_{-2.9}^{+2.8}$ M$_{\\oplus}$ and a radius of 5.53$\\pm$0.18 R$_{\\oplus}$, corresponding to a density of 1.7$\\pm$0.2 g/cm^3. This places it among the rare population of hot and dense super-Neptune desert planets. TOI-3862b, residing deep in the hot Neptune desert, represents a rare occurrence in an otherwise sparsely populated region, offering a valuable opportunity to probe the processes that may allow planets to survive in such environments."}

Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur's wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \\textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System."}

The traditional disturbing function expansion in celestial mechanics shows that, at low eccentricities, $p$:$p-q$ MMRs exhibit a clear hierarchy of strengths, scaling as $e^q$, where $q$ is the order of the resonance. This explains why first-order MMRs (e.g., 3:2 and 4:3) are important, while the infinite number of higher order integer ratios are not. However, this relationship derived from a technical perturbation series expansion provides little physical intuition. In this paper, we provide a simple physical explanation of this result for closely spaced orbits. In this limit, interplanetary interactions are negligible except during close encounters at conjunction, where the planets impart a gravitational \"kick\" to each other's mean motion. We show that while first-order MMRs involve a single conjunction before the configuration repeats, higher order MMRs involve multiple conjunctions per cycle, whose effects cancel out more precisely the higher the order of the resonance. Starting from the effects of a single conjunction, we provide an alternate, physically motivated derivation of MMRs' $e^q$ strength scaling."}

At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii). The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5-4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance."}

Accepted for publication in ApJL", "summary": "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations suggest that the disc of HD 163296 is being actively shaped by embedded, yet unseen protoplanets, as indicated by numerous gas and dust substructures consistent with planet-disc interaction models. We report the first detection of simple organic molecules, HCN and C2H, tracing a candidate circumplanetary disc (CPD) in the HD 163296 system, located at an orbital radius of $R=88\\pm7$ au and azimuth $φ=46\\pm3^\\circ$ (or $R=0.75''$, $\\rm{PA}=350^\\circ$ in projected sky coordinates), and originating near the midplane of the circumstellar disc. The signature is localised but spectrally resolved, and it overlaps with a previously reported planet candidate, P94, identified through kinematic perturbations traced by CO lines. We propose a scenario in which the observed chemical anomalies arise from increased heating driven by the forming planet and ongoing accretion through its CPD, facilitating the thermal desorption of species that would otherwise remain frozen out in the disc midplane, and potentially triggering the activation barriers of chemical reactions that lead to enhanced molecular production. Based on a first-order dynamical analysis of the HCN spectrum from the CPD--isolated with a 7$σ$ significance--we infer an upper limit on the planet mass of 1.8 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, consistent with predictions from CO kinematics and constraints from direct imaging studies. By comparing the CPD sizes derived from our models with theoretical expectations where the CPD radius corresponds to roughly one-third of the planet's Hill radius, we favor CPD gas temperatures $T > 150$ K, planet masses $M_{\\rm p} < 1.0$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$, and CPD radii $R_{\\rm CPD} < 2$ au."}

Despite the associated risk, this scenario offers a rare and valuable scientific opportunity. Using a hybrid framework combining Monte Carlo orbital propagation, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) impact modeling, and N-body ejecta dynamics, we evaluate the physical outcomes and propose the observation timelines of this rare event. Our results suggest an optical flash of visual magnitude from -2.5 to -3 lasting several minutes directly after the impact, followed by hours of infrared afterglow from $\\sim$2000 K molten rock cooling to a few hundred K. The associated seismic energy release would lead to a global-scale lunar reverberation (magnitude $\\sim$5.0) that can be detectable by modern seismometers.
