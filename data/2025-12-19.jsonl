We report the transmission spectrum of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-732 c, observed with JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS between 0.9-12 $μ$m. The observations provide evidence for methane (CH$_4$) in a H$_2$-rich atmosphere, at a volume mixing ratio of $\\sim$1\\%, and non-detection of NH$_3$ and HCN, along with nominal constraints on other prominent molecules H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$, which are typically expected in H$_2$-rich atmospheres. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 250 chemical species and find moderate to strong evidence (up to $\\ln B\\sim 5.9$, $3.9σ$) for additional absorption due to one or more complex molecules including higher-order hydrocarbons and/or sulfur-bearing molecules. The spectral features are strongly degenerate among these molecules and with methane, which we find at $\\ln B=3.2-8.8$ (up to $3.0-4.6$$σ$) significance. Two complex molecules are preferred with at least moderate evidence ($\\ln B \\gtrsim 2.5$) in both the near- and mid-infrared, while several others show such evidence in at least one of the two wavelength ranges. The preferred molecules are found in trace quantities on Earth, with no significant sources identified in other planetary atmospheres, requiring future work to assess their physical plausibility in this planet. Future observations are required to resolve the degeneracies and place more robust constraints on these species. We highlight the need for further theoretical and experimental work to robustly characterize the atmospheric and internal composition of TOI-732 c and similar sub-Neptunes."}

Accepted for publication in The Planetary Science Journal, December 15, 2025", "summary": "Thermal images at different wavelengths probe varying subsurface depths of planetary bodies, and therefore can inform us about their compositions, thermophysical properties, and impact histories. We identified six archival observations of Callisto obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) between 2012 July 17 and 2012 November 4 at wavelengths of 0.43-0.47 mm (701.9-641.5 GHz). These wavelengths are shorter than those of nearly all other Callisto ALMA data and are sensitive to subsurface emission at depths (the upper ~cm) between those sounded by millimeter and infrared observations. We estimate the disk-averaged brightness temperature as 133$\\pm$15 K, and use a thermophysical mixture model to find that Callisto's thermal emission is best fit by a ~50-50% two-component thermal inertia mixture of $Γ_{\\text{low}}$~15-40 and $Γ_{\\text{high}}$~1200-2000 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$, consistent with recent ALMA observations of Callisto at longer wavelengths. Finally, we present several previously unpublished Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) observations of Callisto and derive thermal inertia and spectral emissivity maps using the same model. Altogether, these ALMA and PPR maps improve our understanding of the thermal properties and spatial distribution of Callisto's shallow subsurface regolith, and demonstrate the value of ALMA flux density calibrator data for extending frequency coverage of existing science data."}

With the impact scenario, Deimos (or its precursors) were formed or were pushed out beyond the synchronous orbit of Mars. Moons interior to the synchronous orbit, including Phobos (or its precursors), would tidally evolve and resonances between these moons could potentially excite Deimos' orbit. This contradicts Deimos' present-day orbit of low eccentricity ($0.00027$) and moderate inclination ($1.8^\\circ$ to the Laplace plane). Tidal dissipation within Deimos is too inefficient for eccentricity damping, and without alternative mechanisms, Deimos' present-day orbit places strong constraints on the evolution of any inner moons. We propose that a runaway collisional cascade called the \"sesquinary catastrophe'' acts as a natural barrier that prevents Deimos from having a more excited orbit. Using N-body simulations with collisional fragmentation, we show that if Deimos was more excited, it would undergo a sesquinary catastrophe and break apart into a Roche-exterior debris disk. Using a measure of sesquinary orbital excitation called $q$, our simulations and previous works suggest that breakup occurs for $q \\gtrsim 8$ on timescales of $\\sim 10^{3-4}$ years. If Deimos was destroyed in a sesquinary catastrophe and re-accreted from a (likely collisionally) damped debris disk, it should be a porous sand-pile moon, consistent with its smooth surface. The sesquinary catastrophe can be applied to other Deimos-like planetary moons at $q \\gtrsim 8$."}

In this study, we model brightness profiles and geometries for 16 dusty disks in the DSHARP observations to identify asymmetric substructures, including possible planet-induced signatures. We find no compelling evidence for circumplanetary emission in these systems. We identify a possible one-armed spiral in Elias 27; while previous studies report an $m=2$ spiral, the morphology of the newly identified spiral agrees with a spiral for a possible protoplanet. Although non-detection of circumplanetary emission is consistent with low expected luminosities, the absence of additional dust spirals except for Elias 27 may constrain properties of potential embedded planets given their theoretical detectability. The analyses further suggest that spiral amplitudes and phases correlated with gap and ring locations in WaOph 6 and IM Lup, appearing as deflections of spirals in images. Five disks exhibit strong residual asymmetries attributable to the vertical extent of their dust layers. We find that the brightness temperature of inner disks ($1$-$5$ au) declines with stellar age on a $\\sim 3$ Myr timescale, while the total flux shows no clear decreasing trend. This trend is consistent with the presence of pressure bumps that retain large dust grains at outer radii, while allowing the inner disks to disperse. The universality of disk dispersal timescale at millimeter wavelengths, observed in both the extended DSHARP disks and the compact disks from previous demographic surveys, may constrain timing of planet formation, including habitable planets."}

To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and θ_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions."}

Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres."}

Using a combination of analytic arguments and N-body simulations including equilibrium tides and general relativistic precession, we find the boundary in parameter space where an inner companion can remain dynamically stable. We find that survival requires a periastron separation exceeding roughly 14 mutual Hill radii at closest approach. Below this threshold, secular eccentricity exchange, orbit crossing, and/or tidal evolution can lead to the destruction of the inner planet. We apply our methodology to the current exoplanet sample and find that none of the known systems containing a short-period giant and an inner companion could have assembled via high-eccentricity tidal migration. However, warm Jupiters with larger periastron distances ($q_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim 0.05-0.08$ AU, corresponding to final observed semi-major axis values $a_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim 0.10-0.16$ AU) can allow the survival of short-period inner planets while potentially also circularizing on $\\lesssim 1$ Gyr timescales.

Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using one-dimensional models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature $\\sim 280$~K) as a benchmark, we compute three-dimensional atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10~bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics of global temperature contrast, the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but require integration a few times longer. These three-dimensional effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on one-dimensional models. We also assess their detectability for other nearby exoplanets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate three-dimensional atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data."}

Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra."}

This study compares three General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Venusian atmosphere up to the exosphere: the Venus Planetary Climate Model (Venus PCM), the Venus Thermospheric Global Model (VTGCM) and the Tohoku University GCM (TUGCM), focusing on their nominal simulations (e.g. composition, thermal structure and heating/cooling rates). Similarities and discrepancies among them are discussed in this paper, together with data-models comparison. The nominal simulations analyzed in this study fail to accurately reproduce the daytime observations of Pioneer Venus, notably overestimating the exospheric temperature. This is linked to an underestimation of the atomic oxygen (O) abundance in the three GCMs, and suggests the need of additional O production in the thermosphere. The selection of solar spectrum is also the main reason for the discrepancies between the models in terms of temperature dependence on solar activity. A list of recommendations is proposed aiming at improving the modeling of Venus' upper atmosphere, among them: 1. Standardize the EUV-UV solar spectrum input. 2. Update the near-infrared heating scheme with Venus Express-Era data. 3. Reassess Radiative cooling schemes. 4. Investigate the underestimated atomic Oxygen abundance."}

The same solar analog was used for both observations to remove one source of inconsistency. We measured spectral slopes of 2.51% $\\pm$ 0.05%/100 nm and 8.13% $\\pm$ 0.05%/100 nm at the two different rotational phases. The first of these measurements was serendipitously obtained during an occultation of Menoetius by Patroclus. Although the statistical significance of the spectral slope discrepancy persists even after considering possible systematic errors stemming from differences in slit position angles and air masses between the asteroid and solar analog exposures, we consider this report of variability to be tentative. We briefly explore several scenarios that could explain the measured spectral slope variability. Additional follow-up observations are necessary to definitively confirm and characterize any inhomogeneities across the surface, which will have major implications for the 2033 flyby of Patroclus-Menoetius by the Lucy spacecraft."}

While most studies on terrestrial planet formation assume planar configurations, wide binaries likely feature random inclinations, potentially disrupting planet-forming disks. This study explores the evolution of embryo-planetesimal disks in S-type motion in misaligned binary systems, focusing on the stage after the gas phase when terrestrial planet formation begins and gravitational interactions dominate. Using our GPU-accelerated N-body code GANBISS, we simulate disks with 2,000 planetesimals and 25 planetary embryos, studying the influence of the planetesimals on the evolution of the embryos and tracking their growth through collisions. After the simulations, we analyse collision outcomes with an analytical model. Moreover, for certain inclined binary configurations, we compare dynamically excited (perturbed by the secondary star) with cold disks in inclined configurations, as the distribution after the gas phase in misaligned binaries remains unclear. Our simulations reveal two key outcomes: (i) embryos migrate slightly inward in misaligned systems, and (ii) The initial large oscillations in embryos' inclinations and nodes around the respective values of the secondary star dampen over time. Collision analysis shows distinct differences: planar systems favour accretive collisions, while inclined configurations exhibit more destructive events. These findings underscore the sensitivity of planet formation dynamics to binary star alignment and initial disk conditions."}
