Abstract: Future lunar missions will depend on an internationally agreed upon timescale
that remains accurate under the Moon's unique gravitational environment and its
orbital dynamics. This thesis investigates the proposed Lunar Coordinate Time
(TCL), derived analogously to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and thus aligned
with current IAU proposals. We first formalise the TCL transformation and
quantify its characteristics from solar system simulations. Next, we compute
stationary surface-clock drifts caused by gravitational redshift and the Moon's
changing orientation parameters, evaluating how accurate atomic clocks deployed
on the surface of the Moon (much like for ESA's proposed NovaMoon mission)
would have to be to measure these effects. Finally, we simulate relativistic
proper time for ESA's Moonlight navigation satellites, identifying average
drift and harmonic variations, to better understand the system that will
comprise and enable a Lunar PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing)
architecture. These kinds of investigations are an essential step toward a
sustained internationally cooperative operation at the lunar south pole and
beyond.

### [2] [Snowball Bistability Vanishes at Moderate Orbital Eccentricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08994)
*Xuan Ji,Dorian S. Abbot*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究发现行星轨道偏心率增加会消除雪球地球气候的双稳态性，雪球状态在季节性变化增强时失去稳定性，这可能意味着复杂生命的出现条件比之前认为的更罕见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雪球地球事件与大气氧含量增加和生命复杂性发展相关，可能是系外行星复杂生命发展的必要条件。研究旨在探索雪球气候双稳态对行星参数的敏感性。

Method: 使用ExoCAM全球气候模型研究水行星在不同轨道偏心率下的气候行为，并结合低阶冰热力学模型分析雪球状态失稳的物理机制。

Result: 当轨道偏心率增加到0.2-0.3时，雪球气候双稳态消失，雪球状态因季节性日照变化增强而失去稳定性，而温暖状态由于海洋热容量大保持稳定。

Conclusion: 雪球气候双稳态对行星参数（如偏心率、恒星质量、自转周期等）的敏感性表明，复杂生命出现的条件可能比Copernican原则预测的更罕见，更符合罕见地球假说。

Abstract: Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the
complexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of
complex life on exoplanets. Sustained stable Snowball episodes require a
Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered
Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate
bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the Global
Climate Model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3.
This happens because the Snowball state loses stability as seasonal insolation
variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's
large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that
the Snowball state loses stability as seasonality increases because winter
freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top
due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that
Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars,
ones with longer rotation periods, and disappears entirely for tidally locked
planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as
robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect
of habitability more consistent with the Rare Earth Hypothesis than the
Copernican Principle.

### [3] [Dust growth and planet formation by disc fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09305)
*Hans Lee,Sergei Nayakshin,Richard A. Booth*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究发现尘粒增长通过降低不透明度促进原行星相碎裂，使得气体巨行星的形成可能性增加


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别尘粒增长对不透明度的重要影响在以前的碎裂模型中被忽略，而这可能改变对形成气体巨行星的理解

Method: 采用依赖于温度和最大粒径的尘粒不透明度模型，分析急创碎裂的原行星相的性质

Result: 尘粒增长可能促进碎裂发生在约30天文单位的距离，降低了临界相质量和吸积速率，初始碎片质量处于气体巨行星范围

Conclusion: 碎裂形成气体巨行星可能比以前认为的更常见，但需要数值模型来考虑尘粒运动和碎片后续演化等因素

Abstract: It is often argued that gravitational instability of realistic protoplanetary
discs is only possible at distances larger than $\sim 50$ au from the central
star, requiring high disc masses and accretion rates, and that therefore disc
fragmentation results in the production of brown dwarfs rather than gas giant
planets. However, the effects of dust growth on opacity can be very significant
but have not been taken into account systematically in the models of
fragmenting discs. We employ dust opacity that depends on both temperature and
maximum grain size to evaluate analytically the properties of a critically
fragmenting protoplanetary disc. We find that dust growth may promote disc
fragmentation at disc radii as small as $\sim 30$ au. As a result, the critical
disc masses and accretion rates are smaller, and the initial fragment masses
are in the gas giant planet mass regime. While this suggests that formation of
gas giant planets by disc fragmentation may be more likely than usually
believed, we caution that numerical models of the process are needed to
evaluate the effects not taken into account here, e.g., dust grain mobility and
fragment evolution after disc fragmentation.

### [4] [A Radially Resolved Magnetic Field Threading the Disk of TW Hya](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09450)
*Richard Teague,Boy Lankhaar,Sean M. Andrews,Chunhua Qi,Roger R. Fu,David J. Wilner,John B. Biersteker,Joan R. Najita*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过CN分子发射的差分展宽来探测和表征原行星盘磁场的新方法，利用ALMA观测数据成功恢复了径向分辨的磁场结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发新的技术方法来探测原行星盘中的磁场，因为磁场在行星形成过程中起着重要作用，但传统方法存在局限性

Method: 使用ALMA观测CN分子的N=1-0跃迁超精细组分，通过拟合包含盘速度结构、非LTE激发和塞曼效应的模型来解析磁场

Result: 在60-120天文单位范围内检测到约10mG强度的磁场，发现60天文单位处主要为极向场，82天文单位处转变为盘平面内的场，并获得了局部气体密度的下限

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对原行星盘磁场的空间分辨探测，为研究行星形成过程中的磁场作用提供了新的观测手段

Abstract: We present a new approach to detecting and characterizing a magnetic field in
protoplanetary disks through the differential broadening of unpolarized
molecular emission from CN. To demonstrate this technique, we apply it to new
ALMA observations of the full complement of hyperfine components from the
$N=1-0$ transition, achieving a spatial and spectral resolution of
${\approx}\,0.5^{\prime\prime}$ and $80~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$, respectively. By
fitting a model that incorporates the velocity structure of the disk, the
potential non-LTE excitation of the molecule, and the Zeeman effect, we recover
a radially resolved magnetic field with a strength of ${\sim}10~{\rm mG}$
between 60 and 120~au. The morphology of the field is also inferred through
azimuthal variations in the line broadening, revealing a predominantly poloidal
field at 60~au, sharply transitioning to one within the disk plane outside of
the gap at 82~au. The signal-to-noise ratio of the data meant that the planar
component was unable to be decomposed into toroidal and radial components.
Lower limits on the local gas density ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^8~{\rm
cm^{-3}}$) from the excitation analysis of the CN emission correspond to a
lower limit between 0.1 and 0.01 for the plasma $\beta$.

### [5] [YSES 2b is a background star: Differential astrometric M-dwarf measurements in time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09504)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: YSES 2b被确认为一个距离YSES 2恒星超过2千秒差距的后方M型矮星，而非其伴星，主要通过GRAVITY天体测量识别出其视差运动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确认YSES 2b的真实性质，区分其是YSES 2恒星的亚恒星伴星还是具有非零自行运动的遥远背景源

Method: 使用SPHERE和GRAVITY进行天体测量，测量YSES 2b相对于YSES 2恒星的位置，并通过多个时期的GRAVITY天体测量识别亚毫角秒级的视差运动

Result: YSES 2b是一个晚型M矮星，位于银河系旋臂内，横向速度约300 km/s，距离YSES 2恒星超过2千秒差距

Conclusion: YSES 2b不是YSES 2的伴星，而是一个遥远的背景恒星，通过精确的视差测量成功区分了这两种可能性

Abstract: We wish to confirm the nature of YSES 2b, a purportedly faint companion of
the young star YSES 2. We used on-sky observations from SPHERE and GRAVITY to
measure the astrometric position of 2b with respect to the star YSES 2, and
examined the competing hypotheses of (i) a bound substellar companion versus
(ii) a distant unrelated background source with a non-zero proper motion. YSES
2b appears to be a late-type M-dwarf star over 2 kiloparsecs behind the star
YSES 2. It has a transverse velocity of about 300 km/s and is located within
one of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The main discriminant was multiple epochs
of GRAVITY astrometry that identified the sub-milliarcsecond parallactic motion
of the star.
