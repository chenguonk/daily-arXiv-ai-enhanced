This is the authors' version. See the ancillary file for an animation associated with Fig. 2", "summary": "A population of free-floating planets is known from gravitational microlensing surveys. None have a directly measured mass, owing to a degeneracy with the distance, but the population statistics indicate that many are less massive than Jupiter. We report a microlensing event -- KMT-2024-BLG-0792/OGLE-2024-BLG-0516, which was observed from both ground- and space-based telescopes -- that breaks the mass-distance degeneracy. The event was caused by an object with 0.219^{+0.075}_{-0.046} Jupiter masses that is either gravitationally unbound or on a very wide orbit. Through comparison with the statistical properties of other observed microlensing events and predictions from simulations, we infer that this object likely formed in a protoplanetary disk (like a planet), not in isolation (like a brown dwarf), and dynamical processes then ejected it from its birth place, producing a free-floating object."}

We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that inefficient mantle cooling can retain sufficient heat to Gyr ages: inefficient heat transport from mantle to envelope alone keeps radii $\\sim$10\\% larger than predicted by adiabatic models at late times. Silicate rain can contribute an additional $\\sim$5\\% to the radius, depending on envelope mass and initial metal abundance. The silicate-hydrogen immiscibility region may lie in the middle or even upper envelope, far above the envelope-mantle boundary layer, and bifurcates the envelope into two an upper, hydrogen-rich region and a lower, metal-rich region above the mantle. If silicate rain occurs, atmospheres should appear depleted of silicates while radii remain inflated at late ages. To demonstrate this, we present interior evolution models for GJ 1214 b, K2-18 b, TOI-270 d, and TOI-1801 b, showing that hot, liquid silicate mantles with thin envelopes reproduce their radii and mean densities, providing an alternative to water-world interpretations. These results imply that bulk compositions inferred from mean density must account for mantle thermal state and envelope mixing/phase separation history; such thermal ``memories'' may constrain formation entropies and temperatures when metallicities are better measured."}

We identified this comet to be the minor planet (139359) 2001 ME1 whose previously unnoticed dust activity near perihelion became optically amplified by efficient forward scattering of sunlight as the comet crossed between the Sun and SOHO/Earth at up to 175.6 deg phase angle. Simultaneous backscattering observations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) precisely constrain the comet's ~7 mag forward scattering brightening, enabling a direct comparison with the ~3 mag brightening of the more active but optically dust-poor comet 2P/Encke seen by SOHO and STEREO under similar geometry in 2017. Earlier STEREO observations from 2014 additionally show the newly recognized activity to be recurrent -- consistent with a reanalysis of the comet's associated meteor activity -- and has likely only been previously overlooked due to the comet's faintness and proximity to the Sun while active. Orbital integrations show the comet has likely followed a near-Earth orbit for at least the past 10 kyr, suggesting that the weakness of its observed activity evolved through its continued depletion of accessible volatiles."}

Even though no conclusive evidence has been found for atmospheres on small rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs, recent JWST observations identified puzzling thermal emission excesses: some rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs have dayside emission temperatures higher than the theoretical maximum. Theoretical maximum temperatures assume stellar irradiation as the sole energy source, implying that these planets may have internal heat sources. In this work, we simulate three possible planetary internal processes that may generate excessive heat in addition to stellar irradiation: residual heating from formation, tidal heating, and induction heating due to interactions with the stellar magnetic field. We found that these mechanisms, even when combined, cannot explain the observed thermal emission excesses, nor can they explain a tentative positive trend in the brightness temperature scaling factor as a function of irradiation temperature. Our results imply that planetary internal processes are unlikely to generate remotely detectable heat, so the observed thermal excesses, if astrophysical, are likely caused by stellar contamination, surface processes, or other internal processes not considered in this study. The ongoing JWST-HST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time Program and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide more insights into the thermal emission of rocky exoplanets."}

ApJ accepted", "summary": "Atmospheric variations over time and space boost planetary cooling, as outgoing internal flux responds to stellar radiation and opacity. Vertical mixing regulates this cooling. Our study examines how gravity waves or large-scale induced mixing interact with radiation transfer, affecting temperature inhomogeneity and internal flux. Through the radiative-convective-mixing equilibrium, mixing increases temperature inhomogeneity in the middle and lower atmospheres, redistributing internal flux. Stronger stellar radiation and mixing significantly reduce outgoing flux, slowing cooling. With constant infrared (IR) opacity, lower visible opacity and stronger mixing significantly reduce outgoing flux. Jensen's inequality implies that greater spatial disparities in stellar flux and opacity elevate the ratio of the average internal flux in inhomogeneous columns relative to that in homogeneous columns. This effect, particularly pronounced under high opacity contrasts, amplifies deep-layer temperature inhomogeneity and may enhance cooling. However, with mixing, overall cooling is weaker than without, as both the averaged internal flux of the inhomogeneous columns and that of the homogeneous column decline more sharply for the latter. Thus, while vertical mixing-induced inhomogeneity can enhance cooling, the overall cooling effect remains weaker than in the non-mixing case. Therefore, vertical mixing, by regulating atmospheric structure and flux, is key to understanding planetary cooling."}

Its orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for testing mechanisms such as tidal heating and high-eccentricity migration, yet previous measurements have remained inconclusive. Due to the large radial velocity jitter caused by stellar activity, and the presence of at least one additional planet in the system, previous radial velocity measurements could not robustly determine the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Here we combine the new JWST secondary eclipse data with transit timing data from HST, TESS, and JWST to measure the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Our joint analysis shows that WASP-107~b has an eccentricity of $0.09\\pm0.02$, a mass of $0.096\\pm0.005 \\, M_J$, and an orbital period of $5.721487\\pm0.000001$~days. We find the $99.7\\%$ lower limit of the eccentricity is about 0.04. These new measurements are consistent with the scenario in which WASP-107~b is in the final stage of high-eccentricity migration. Preliminary estimate shows that eccentricity-driven tidal dissipation can provide a significant contribution to the energy required to sustain the observed radius inflation of WASP-107~b. Our results establish the dynamical status of one of the most intriguing low-density exoplanets known, and offer new insights into its formation and evolution history."}

The prevailing view for the origin of this three-body resonance involves the convergent migration of the moons, resulting from gas-driven torques in the circum-Jovian disk wherein they accreted. To account for Callisto's exclusion from the resonant chain, a late and/or slow accretion of the fourth and outermost Galilean moon is typically invoked, stalling its migration. Here, we consider an alternative scenario in which Callisto's nonresonant orbit is a consequence of disk substructure. Using a suite of N-body simulations that self-consistently account for satellite-disk interactions, we show that a pressure bump can function as a migration trap, isolating Callisto and alleviating constraints on its timing of accretion. Our simulations position the bump interior to the birthplaces of all four moons. In exploring the impact of bump structure on simulation outcomes, we find that it cannot be too sharp nor flat to yield the observed orbital architecture. In particular, a \"Goldilocks\" zone is mapped in parameter space, corresponding to a well-defined range in bump aspect ratio. Within this range, Io, Europa, and Ganymede are sequentially trapped at the bump, and ushered across it through resonant lockstep migration with their neighboring, exterior moon. The implications of our work are discussed in the context of uncertainties regarding Callisto's interior structure, arising from the possibility of non-hydrostatic contributions to its shape and gravity field, unresolved by the Galileo spacecraft."}
