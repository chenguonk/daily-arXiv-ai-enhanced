Alvarado-Montes"], "title": "Hot Jupiters in Old Wide-Binary Systems", "comment": "comments are welcome", "summary": "Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods shorter than $10$ days, found around $\\sim 0.5$-$1\\%$ of Sun-like stars. Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\\lesssim 30\\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $<40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a > 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \\ge 2.5\\ \\rm Gyr$. In $\\sim 20\\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys."}

In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk."}

Maciejewski et al. 2021; S. R. Hagey et al. 2022; E. S. Ivshina & J. N. Winn 2022; W. Wang et al. 2024; L. C. Yeh et al. 2024). While WASP-12 b's decreasing period is well-explained by tidally induced orbital decay (K. C. Patra et al. 2017), and stellar acceleration has been proposed for WASP-4 b (L. G. Bouma et al. 2020), the cause of the apparent trend for TrES-5 b has not been satisfactorily explained. This work extends the previous observations with 14 new ground-based transits from 2016-2024 and two newly-published midtimes for data from 2007 and 2009. Four TESS sectors (75, 77, 82, and 84) have also been included for the first time. With the new data, the case for a decreasing orbital period is much weaker than before. The revised rate of period change, dP/dt=-5.3 +/- 2.2 ms yr^-1, is less than half that was found in previous work and the preference for a quadratic over a linear model, as measured through Delta BIC_LQ, has been falling since 2020, with a current value of 11. Furthermore, these results are not robust to outliers; removing a single early transit midtime causes the effect to vanish (Delta BIC_LQ = -1). Additionally, no significant periodic signals in the transit timing data are identified. The current data are well explained by a linear ephemeris."}

It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository."}

The tidal disruption of accreting bodies is thought to form circumstellar dusty disks, whose emission spectra could offer additional insights into the mineral phases of the accreted solid material. Silicates are detected in the mid-infrared spectra of several disks, but do not fully account for the near-infrared excess in the disks' spectra. Conductive materials, such as metallic iron, are potential sources of near-infrared emissivity. We investigate the role of metallic iron within silicate dust in the observed spectra of the white dwarfs G29-38 and GD56. Using thermal emission spectra calculations, we analyze the abundance of metallic iron in the dust and the disk structure parameters that best fit the observed spectra. We find that metallic-iron-bearing dust enhances the near-infrared opacity, thereby providing a better fit to the G29-38 spectrum for various silicate compositions than metallic-iron-free dust. The best-fit metal-to-silicate mixing ratio is approximately unity, and for Mg-rich pyroxenes, this value is also consistent with G29-38's stellar atmospheric composition within 1-$σ$ observational uncertainties. Based on the spectral fitting and compositional consistency, Fe-rich silicates without metallic iron cannot be ruled out. The observed GD56 spectrum also favors iron-bearing dust. However, the large observational uncertainties of GD56's stellar elemental abundances hinder a precise comparison between the stellar and dust iron abundances. Upcoming high-precision JWST observations will provide a larger sample, enabling statistical analysis of the correlation between the iron abundances in the atmospheres and circumstellar dust of polluted white dwarfs."}

Using advanced, GPU-accelerated $N$-body simulations, we model the gravitational dynamics of a massive planetesimal disk perturbed by an inclined, inner planet. Our simulations reveal that self-gravity fundamentally alters the disk's evolution compared to massless models. It enforces a coherent, semi-rigid precession of the disk and enables the rapid formation of a global warp structure within 0.5 Myr. The warp angle undergoes a damped oscillation, eventually settling into a quasi-equilibrium state. By generating synthetic scattered-light images, we demonstrate that our model successfully reproduces the observed S-shaped warp morphology of the debris disk in HD 110058, supporting the existence of an unseen planet. Furthermore, we derive an empirical relationship that connects the equilibrium warp angle to the physical parameters of the disk and the planet. Applying this relation to HD 110058, we constrain its disk mass to be likely less than 1,000 $M_\\oplus$, offering a new dynamical perspective on the debris disk mass problem."}

The formation of dense dust clumps through this process, however, is possible provided it involves solids with dimensionless stopping times $\\sim 0.1$ in standard discs, which typically corresponds to 1-10 cm-sized particles. This implies that dust coagulation is required for the SI to be an efficient process. Here, we employ unstratified, shearing-box simulations combined with a moment equation for solving the coagulation equation to examine the effect of dust growth on the SI. In dust-rich discs with a dust-to-gas ratio $ε\\gtrsim 1$, coagulation is found to have little impact on the SI; while in dust-poor discs with $ε\\sim 0.01$, we observe the formation of vertically extended filaments through the action of the coagulation instability (CI), which is triggered due to the dependence of coagulation efficiency on dust density. For moderate dust-to-gas ratios $ε\\sim 0.1$ and Stokes numbers $St \\lesssim 0.1$, we find onset of the SI within these filaments, with a linear growth rate significantly higher compared to standard SI. We refer to this regime as coagulation-assisted SI. The synergy between both instabilities in that case leads to isotropic turbulence and dust concentrations that are increased by a factor of $30-40$. As dust continues to grow, SI tends to overcome the effect of the CI such that the nonlinear saturation phase is similar to pure SI. Our results suggest that coagulation, by simply increasing dust size, may facilitate the formation of dense clumps through the SI; even though it has only little effect on its nonlinear evolution."}

Orbital stability of exoplanets formed around double white dwarfs", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A on 11/12/2025, abstract shortened, 18 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "Planetary formation might occur at different stages of the stellar evolution of compact binaries. In recent years, the formation of second-generation planets has been tested in circumbinary discs formed by the ejection of stellar material from double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. In these environments, planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to giant masses can form and migrate to within 1 au of the central binary. Nevertheless, studies on the orbital stability of such systems have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the stability of multi-planet systems formed around compact DWDs in both resonant and non-resonant configurations over timescales of a few million years. We track the occurrence of catastrophic events and employ a variety of metrics, e.g., orbital spacing, centre-of-mass variations and Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit, to explore the outcomes of their evolution. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential for detecting these systems in their final configurations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by measuring the overall gravitational-wave frequency shift amplitude induced by their planets. Our results show that planets orbiting DWDs can be stable over the studied timescales. While planetary systems starting with two-planets are more likely to survive unaltered, planetary systems with three, four or five planets, experience catastrophic events that cause them to lose some of their original planets, ending up hosting only two surviving planets in the majority of cases. This increases the number of two-planet systems by 122% with respect to their initial abundance and creates a single-planet population amounting to 7% of the totality of systems. The majority of these single-planet systems are potential candidates for LISA. Concerning multi-planet systems, a handful of systems could be detected."}

They are also the most active annual shower, enabling detailed studies of the dependence of their physical and mechanical properties on mass. We calculated the fragmentation cascades of 39 bright Geminid fireballs, as well as faint video meteors, to derive fragmentation pressures and other physical properties characterizing the meteoroids, such as their bulk densities. Our goal is to describe the mechanical properties across a broad range of initial masses and explain the cause of the observed behavior. We used a physical fragmentation model with a semiautomatic method based on parallel genetic algorithms to fit the radiometric and regular light curve and dynamics data. We also calculated the thermal stress of model bodies with the type of physical properties and trajectories as the observed Geminids. Then, we compared the outcomes of these simulations to our observations. We find that the Geminids are probably cracked by thermal stress in the atmosphere first and then eroded by mechanical forces. The most compact Geminids are in the 20-200 g mass range. The largest observed meteoroids have a wide range of grain sizes, from about 20 um to large, non-fragmenting parts of 1-20 mm in size. The derived bulk densities range from about 1400 to 2800 kg/m3 for smaller meteoroids and approach the assumed grain density of 3000 kg/m3 for larger Geminids."}
