Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly-observed sulfur-bearing species and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snowline. Despite this, few dedicated multi-line observations exist, and thus the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry - and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir - varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from ALMA, SMA, and NOEMA of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of ${\\approx}$10-40 K and column densities between 10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S$^+$ and C$^+$ drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf912\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u76d8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u7684CS\u5206\u5b50\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CS\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6052\u661fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660eCS\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u5c42\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u5b50-\u4e2d\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u786b\u5316\u5b66\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u751f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u5728\u5b9c\u5c45\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u786b\u5206\u5b50\u5e93\u5b58\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46CS\u4ecd\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u542b\u786b\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u8ba1\u662f\u6c34\u96ea\u7ebf\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6c14\u76f8\u786b\u8f7d\u4f53\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8c31\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u7684\u76d8CS\u5316\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8be5\u5316\u5b66\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6052\u661f\u548c\u76d8\u7279\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408ALMA\u3001SMA\u548cNOEMA\u7684\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6863\u6848\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf912\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u76d8\u8fdb\u884cCS\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u6052\u661f\u5149\u8c31\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u5f62\u6001\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6e90\u7684\u76d8\u79ef\u5206CS\u6c14\u4f53\u6fc0\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "CS\u5316\u5b66\u5728\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ea610-40K\uff0c\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u572810^12-10^13 cm^-2\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002CS\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u65e0\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6052\u661fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660eCS\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u5c42\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u5b50-\u4e2d\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528CS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c14\u76f8\u786b\u4e30\u5ea6\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u81f4\u8003\u8651\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5bf9X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0cCS\u5f62\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7X\u5c04\u7ebf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684S+\u548cC+\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79bb\u5b50-\u4e2d\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine.

Abstract abridged for arXiv requirements", "summary": "Light scattering by dust particles is often modeled assuming the dust is spherical for numerical simplicity and speed. However, real dust particles have highly irregular morphologies that significantly affect their scattering properties. We have developed glitterin, a neural network trained to predict light scattering from irregularly shaped dust grains, offering a computationally efficient alternative to Lorenz-Mie theory. We computed scattering properties using the Discrete Dipole Approximation code ADDA for irregularly shaped particles across size parameters x from 0.1 to 65, covering a range in complex refractive index m that includes astrosilicates, pyroxene, enstatite, water-ice, etc. The neural network operates at millisecond timescales while maintaining superior accuracy compared to linear interpolation. Irregular grains exhibit x-dependent deviations from spherical predictions. At small x, cross-sections approach volume-equivalent spheres for low m. At large x, irregular grains show enhanced cross-sections due to greater geometric extension. Increasing m also enhances the absorption cross-section relative to the volume-equivalent spheres. This differential x and m dependence creates mid-IR solid-state features distinct from predictions from spherical grains. Validation against laboratory measurements of forsterite and hematite demonstrates that our neural network captures both qualitative and quantitative behaviors more accurately than spherical models. Millimeter-wavelength applications reveal that spherical grains produce opposite polarization signatures compared to irregular grains, potentially relaxing stringent ~100um grain size constraints in protoplanetary disks. glitterin is publicly available and alleviates the computational barriers to incorporating emission and scattering of realistic grain morphologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86glitterin\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u72b6\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u5149\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7403\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u5c18\u57c3\u9897\u7c92\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u4e3a\u7403\u5f62\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ADDA\u79bb\u6563\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee3\u7801\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u72b6\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcglitterin\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5149\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53c2\u6570x\u4ece0.1\u523065\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6298\u5c04\u7387m\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7403\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728x\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c0fx\u65f6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f53\u79ef\u7b49\u6548\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u5927x\u65f6\u56e0\u51e0\u4f55\u5ef6\u4f38\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u622a\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "glitterin\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eb3\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u9897\u7c92\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The presence of a stellar companion can strongly influence the architecture and long-term stability of planetary systems. Motivated by the discovery of exoplanets exhibiting extremely high eccentricities (e >= 0.8) in systems with a binary companion, we investigate how planetary orbits around one star (S-type configuration) evolve under the gravitational perturbations of the companion. Aims. We aim to assess the role of a stellar companion in shaping the orbital evolution of S-type planets and to explore whether dynamical interactions in such environments can account for the formation of highly eccentric planets. Methods. We performed a suite of N-body simulations, modeling systems initially composed of three Jupiter-mass planets on nearly circular, coplanar orbits around the primary star. We systematically varied the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the stellar companion, to characterize the conditions under which extreme eccentricities can be excited. Results. Our results show that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular mechanisms--including the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov effect induced by the binary--often act together to produce abrupt and significant changes in planetary orbital evolution, with the outcome strongly dependent on the binary separation. The binary's eccentricity primarily dictates the number of surviving planets, while its inclination not only governs the final eccentricities of those survivors but also drives their orbits to align with the binary plane. Our simulations successfully reproduce the high eccentricities and compact orbits observed in four observed systems, showing close agreement between the modeled configurations and the actual systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dS\u578b\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov\u6548\u5e94\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u8f68\u9053\u884c\u661f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387(e\u22650.8)\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u5bf9S\u578b\u884c\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884cN\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6728\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u884c\u661f\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e3b\u661f\u505a\u8fd1\u5706\u5f62\u5171\u9762\u8f68\u9053\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u6052\u661f\u4f34\u661f\u7684\u534a\u957f\u8f74\u3001\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u503e\u89d2\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u661f\u5206\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\u6f14\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f34\u661f\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u51b3\u5b9a\u5e78\u5b58\u884c\u661f\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f34\u661f\u503e\u89d2\u63a7\u5236\u6700\u7ec8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u9ad8\u504f\u5fc3\u7387\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u884c\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u6563\u5c04\u548cvon Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Using a Bayesian retrieval framework, we constrain its dayside pressure-temperature profile and abundances of Fe, Ni, and Ca, providing the first measurements for Ni and Ca for KELT-20 b in emission. We retrieve the pre- and post-eclipse datasets separately (corresponding to the evening and morning sides, respectively), and compare the constraints on their thermal structures and chemical abundances. We constrain lower abundances in the pre-eclipse datasets compared to the post-eclipse datasets. We interpret these results with an equilibrium chemistry model which suggests ~10-30x supersolar refractory abundances. Due to the well-known degeneracy between absolute abundances and continuum opacities, the abundance ratios are more precise probes of the planetary abundances. Therefore we measure the abundance ratios [Ni/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] across these datasets and find they agree within 1-sigma. We constrain [Ni/Fe] to be consistent with solar within 2-sigma, and [Ca/Fe] to be 0.001-0.01x solar, not accounting for ionization. We compare these abundance ratios with literature results for KELT-20 b in transmission, and find they agree within 2-sigma, suggesting that even though the abundances vary significantly as a function of phase, the abundance ratios of these species remain relatively constant. We find a ~100 K difference in temperature at the top of the thermal inversion, suggesting a hotter evening side than morning side and underscoring the importance of considering 3D effects when studying ultra-hot Jupiters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u8d85\u70ed\u6728\u661fKELT-20 b\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u5b66\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86Ni\u548cCa\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u665a\u4e24\u4fa7\u5b58\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u70ed\u6728\u661fKELT-20 b\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u65e5\u591c\u4e24\u4fa7\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528PEPSI\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u5b66\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u6f14\u6846\u67b6\u7ea6\u675f\u538b\u529b-\u6e29\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u548cFe\u3001Ni\u3001Ca\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u98df\u524d\u548c\u98df\u540e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u98df\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e30\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u65e9\u665a\u4e24\u4fa7\u6e29\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u7ea6100K\uff0c[Ni/Fe]\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c[Ca/Fe]\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u503c\u76840.001-0.01\u500d\uff0c\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "KELT-20 b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u76843D\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u65e9\u665a\u4e24\u4fa7\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u7d20\u4e30\u5ea6\u6bd4\u76f8\u5bf9\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u5316\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Pressure data from Sols 182, 361, 504, and 658 reveal seasonal and diurnal fluctuations linked to solar insolation, CO2 condensation and sublimation cycles, and local geomorphology. During Sol 504, an unexpected pressure increase was recorded despite coinciding with the onset of northern winter, suggesting the influence of perihelion and dust-related thermal tides. Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and amplitude show that Jezero exhibits larger diurnal pressure swings than Gale Crater, mainly due to its lower latitude and topographic confinement.

In this paper, we develop a new model to estimate the contact surface radius and the number of contact points as functions of collision velocity, and examine the formation process of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko. Our model is based on the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from numerical simulations and assumes that all the impact energy of the pebbles is used for their mutual compression. We compare our model with numerical simulations of pebble collisions, in which we prepare the initial pebbles in the form of compressed dust aggregate spheres and measure the contact surface and pebble radii using two- and three-dimensional characteristic radii, respectively. We also apply our model to the formation scenario of comet 67P, whose tensile strength and bulk density have already been estimated in the literature. We find that its low tensile strength points to formation via pebble collisions at velocities below $\\sim10\\mathrm{\\ cm\\ s^{-1}}$ when a microscopic filling factor of pebbles is lower than 0.6, suggesting that inelastic bouncing collisions played a role in damping the collision velocities. By assuming that the pebble collision velocity is determined by the transition velocity between bouncing and sticking, we estimate the pebble radius inside comet 67P to be 130 $\\mathrm{\u03bcm}$ or smaller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5375\u77f3\u78b0\u649e\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u9762\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e8667P\u5f57\u661f\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u6297\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5375\u77f3\u7684\u6240\u6709\u51b2\u51fb\u80fd\u91cf\u90fd\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u4e92\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5f57\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u6a21\u5375\u77f3\u78b0\u649e\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f57\u661f\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u7531\u5375\u77f3\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u6297\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u51b2\u51fb\u80fd\u91cf\u7528\u4e8e\u5375\u77f3\u76f8\u4e92\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u7ef4\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a5\u89e6\u8868\u9762\u548c\u5375\u77f3\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "67P\u5f57\u661f\u7684\u4f4e\u62c9\u4f38\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u5375\u77f3\u78b0\u649e\u901f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ea610 cm/s\uff08\u5f53\u5375\u77f3\u5fae\u89c2\u586b\u5145\u56e0\u5b50\u4f4e\u4e8e0.6\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u53cd\u5f39\u78b0\u649e\u5728\u963b\u5c3c\u78b0\u649e\u901f\u5ea6\u4e2d\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u5375\u77f3\u78b0\u649e\u901f\u5ea6\u7531\u53cd\u5f39\u548c\u7c98\u9644\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u901f\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba167P\u5f57\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u5375\u77f3\u534a\u5f84\u4e3a130 \u03bcm\u6216\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5375\u77f3\u78b0\u649e\u5728\u4f4e\u901f\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u63a5\u89e6\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u53cd\u5f39\u78b0\u649e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u963b\u5c3c\u78b0\u649e\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e8667P\u5f57\u661f\u7684\u4f4e\u62c9\u4f38\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

These two parameters are routinely measured and are used to categorise different populations of observed exoplanets. They are also tightly linked to the planet's properties, in particular those of the interior. As such they offer the unique opportunity to interpret the observations and potentially infer the planet's chemistry and structure. Required for the interpretation are models of planetary interiors, calculated a priori, constrained using other available data, and based on the physiochemical properties of mineralogical phases. This article offers an overview of the current knowledge about exoplanet interiors, the fundamental aspects and tools for interior modelling and how to improve the contraints on the models, along with a discussion on the sources of uncertainty. The origin and fate of volatiles, and their role in planetary evolution is discussed. The chemistry and structure of planetary interiors have a pivotal role in the thermal evolution of planets and the development of large scale properties that might become observables with future space missions and ground-based surveys. As such, having reliable and well constrained interior models is of the utmost importance for the advancement of the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u5b66\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6325\u53d1\u6027\u7269\u8d28\u5728\u884c\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u534a\u5f84\u6d4b\u91cf\u662f\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u884c\u661f\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ff\u7269\u76f8\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62e5\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ea6\u675f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Context. True spin-orbit obliquities \u03a8 offer valuable insights into the evolutionary history of exoplanetary systems. Previous studies have suggested that exoplanets tend to occupy either aligned or perpendicular orbits. However, recent research has indicated potential biases caused by the low sample, questioning whether this dichotomy would persist with a larger dataset. Simultaneously, a similar dichotomous behavior has been suggested for Neptune-sized planets. Aims. We aim to investigate the distribution of true spin-orbit obliquities \u03a8 with an enlarged sample, looking for confirmation of the disputed dichotomy previously found, with a focus also on the obliquities of Neptunes. Methods. Starting from a sample of 264 projected obliquities \u03bb, we homogeneously compute true obliquities \u03a8 for 116 planets using the rotation period method. We combine them with 4 further values gathered from literature and we then study their distribution, also as a function of various star-planet system parameters. Results. Our data-driven work based on 120 true obliquities \u03a8 - the largest sample to date - strongly confirms the presence of a single cluster of aligned planets, followed by an isotropic distribution of misaligned planets with no preferred misalignment. This result is based on a uniform distribution of stellar inclinations {i_\\star} , for which non-uniformity could have biased previous interpretations of the arrangement of true obliquities. We confirm that Neptunians show a tentative dichotomous distribution with data available today, but its veracity needs confirmation with an enlarged sample, also because an anisotropic distribution of stellar inclination may be one of the factors hindering the real distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e120\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6837\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u968f\u673a\u9519\u4f4d\u4e24\u79cd\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u884c\u661f\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8c\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5782\u76f4\u8f68\u9053\u4e8c\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5927\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u503e\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u4ece264\u4e2a\u6295\u5f71\u503e\u89d2\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5300\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86116\u4e2a\u884c\u661f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u503e\u89d2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u76844\u4e2a\u503c\uff0c\u5171120\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6052\u661f-\u884c\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u70c8\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u661f\u7c07\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u662f\u968f\u673a\u9519\u4f4d\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4f18\u5148\u9519\u4f4d\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5927\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e8c\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u8d8b\u52bf\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u786e\u8ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u786e\u5b9e\u5448\u73b0\u4e8c\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u6052\u661f\u503e\u89d2\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5927\u5c0f\u884c\u661f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}
