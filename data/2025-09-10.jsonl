Consequently, an exoring may be\ndetectable at a significantly lower contrasts than is required to image the\nexoplanet itself. Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in\nnear-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of\ntwo nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most\nfavorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W +\nMASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times\nthat of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU. Broader\nsimulations indicate that NIRCam can probe large planetary ring systems around\nmature exoplanets comparable in size to circumplanetary disks, which can reach\nup to 1000 times the radius of Saturn's A-ring. These results suggest that\nNIRCam F200W coronagraphy could serendipitously detect large exorings in\nreflected light under the right conditions. A combined analysis of F200W\ncoronagraphic observations of confirmed exoplanets could provide the first\nempirical constraints on the occurrence rate of large exorings. Confirming the\nexistence and frequency of exorings spanning the scale between circumplanetary\ndisks and the rings of the Solar System giant planet could offer new insight\ninto the formation, evolution, and architecture of planetary systems."}

These synthetic planetary systems can however provide\naccess to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between\nthe properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,\nbe used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at\ndiscovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to\ndevelop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and\nstatistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,\ntrained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of\nsynthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,\nfor example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on\nthe transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture\ncorrelations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language\nModels. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and\nstatistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,\nas a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at\npredicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties\nof planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different\ncomparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are\nvery similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model.

In\nthis study, we simulate the ability of space-based coronagraphy missions to\nuncover trends in planetary albedo as a function of instellation, and\npotentially constrain the boundaries of the habitable zone. We adapt the\nBioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the\nscientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a\nsynthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo\nand simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical\npower to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of\nthe injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable\nzone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of\nroughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker\nalbedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission\nis designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would\nbe able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable\nzone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore\nmultiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as\nreducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables\nsuch as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo\nfrom full spectral retrievals."}

To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary\nmethod used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing\nreflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is\nthe high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a\nhigh-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to\naddress these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy,\nand high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the\ndetectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using\nrealistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis\nmethodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting\nrealistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of\nthe AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects\nthrough the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology\nto isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit\nseveral planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced\na method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which\nconstrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming\nan Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b\nin reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to\ncharacterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo.\nIn addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about\n85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO\nto significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling\nreflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets."}

We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow\nline, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the\nSun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in\nthe solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination\nangle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar\ndirection results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation\nlifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other\ndirections.

As the disk evolves and disperses, the truncation radius is\nexpected to move outward as the balance between magnetic and viscous forces\nshifts. Planets migrating inward can become trapped near the inner edge, but as\nthe edge itself moves outward, the evolving disk torques can drive planets to\nmigrate outward as well. We employ N-body simulations to assess the influence\nof magnetospheric cavity expansion on the dynamical evolution and orbital\narchitectures of compact resonant chains of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our\nresults show that rebound-driven expansion of the disk's inner edge plays a\npivotal role in destabilizing resonant chains by spreading planetary systems\noutward, thereby triggering early dynamical instabilities and giant impacts.\nDespite this dynamical evolution, key observable properties of close-in\nplanetary systems -- such as the distribution of orbital period ratio, the\nintra-system similarity in planet sizes (``radius uniformity''), and the\nbimodal distribution of planet radii known as the ``radius valley'' -- remain\nlargely consistent with those of systems formed without the rebound effect, in\nwhich the inner edge of the disk remains fixed.

JADE integrates\nphotoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles\nfrom an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where\ndynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically\nconsidered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar\nspin-orbit angle that has survived within the \"hot Neptune desert\" despite\nongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000\nsimulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian\ninference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the\nproperties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results\nsuggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial\natmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout\nits history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion\ninducing ZLK oscillations.
