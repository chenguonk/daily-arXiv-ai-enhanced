Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoid the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for an optimisation-based gradient descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data."}

Early in its history, Jupiter was more luminous and may have driven substantial atmospheric escape on Io and Europa. We investigate whether Io could have lost its water inventory while Europa retained its volatiles, assuming both moons initially accreted hydrous silicates. The formation and early thermal evolution of the protosatellites are modeled using an interior evolution model coupled with an atmospheric escape framework. Dehydration timescales and volatile losses for Io and Europa are computed during their early evolution, accounting for accretional heating from both satellitesimal and pebble accretion, as well as irradiation from Jupiter's primordial luminosity. Europa likely retained most of its volatiles under nearly all plausible formation and evolution scenarios, as large-scale dehydration would have taken place only after the first 10 Myr of its evolution. In contrast, Io was unlikely to lose a substantial amount of water through atmospheric escape and therefore probably accreted predominantly anhydrous silicates. If Europa initially accreted hydrous minerals, the present-day volatile contrast between Io and Europa could be explained by their relative locations with respect to the phyllosilicate dehydration line in the Jovian subnebula. Distinct evolutionary pathways or atmospheric escape processes alone appear insufficient to reproduce the observed differences."}

New alpha-Enhanced Exoplanet Hosts", "comment": "Submitted to AAS Journals", "summary": "Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way."}

However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcoming $\\textit{Twinkle}$ mission. $\\textit{Twinkle}$ is a spectroscopic satellite covering 0.5--4.5 micron with a spectral resolving power of R $\\sim$ 50--70. Using a physically motivated model, we simulate white-light photometric phase curve observations for 14 UHJs in $\\textit{Twinkle's}$ field of regard. We project that $\\textit{Twinkle}$ will be able to detect all phase curve signals in our survey. Additionally, we simulate spectroscopic phase curves for the UHJ, WASP-189b. From our simulated spectroscopic phase curves, we generate mock phase-resolved emission spectra. Previously detected UHJ molecules (e.g. H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$) produce notable features in the resulting spectra, allowing for detailed atmospheric characterization to study the 3D structure of UHJ atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. For planets with hotspot phase offsets, $\\textit{Twinkle}$ will be capable of detecting them both in the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. This future survey would represent the first UHJ phase curve survey with simultaneous coverage in optical and infrared wavelengths and will provide new constraints and reveal intriguing trends in these extreme environments."}

Outstanding questions include the role of collisions in depleting meteoroids on highly evolved orbits and the relative importance of delivery resonances. Those depend on size, with current dynamical models considering only asteroids larger than 10m in diameter. Based on 1,202 sporadic meteoroids observed by the Global Fireball Observatory, we created a debiased model of the near-Earth meteoroid population in the 10g - 150kg in size (approximately 1cm - 0.5m) as they dynamically evolved from the main asteroid belt onto Earth-crossing orbits. The observed impact population is best matched with a collisional half-life decreasing from 3Myr for meteoroids of 0.6kg (7cm) or higher, to 1Myr below this size, extending to the model lower bound of 10g. Placing our results in context with near-Earth object models for larger sizes, we find that the inner main belt continues to dominate feeding the small 1m to 10m diameter population primarily via the $ν_6$ secular resonance and the 3:1J mean motion resonance. We also evaluated the potential significance of physical processes other than collisions on Earth-impacting meteoroids, such as low-perihelion disruptions from thermal stresses."}

To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \\rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($>10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 > 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods."}
