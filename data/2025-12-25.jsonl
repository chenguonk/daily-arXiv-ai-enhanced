We present new measurements of SO$_2$ ice from 6.8-8.5 $μ$m toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 $L_\\odot$ (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 $L_\\odot$ (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 $μ$m CH$_4$ band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO$_2$ feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO$_2$ laboratory ices were tested: pure SO$_2$ ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO$_2$ ice (lower and upper limits); CH$_3$OH:SO$_2$ ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H$_2$O:SO$_2$ ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO$_2$ ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO$_2$ in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO$_2$ ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO$_2$ as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding ``missing sulfur'' problem."}

We present quantum mechanical $j_z$-conserving coupled-states calculations of state-resolved cross sections for H/D--CO$_2$ collisions at energies up to 5~eV, benchmarked to within 7\\% of close-coupling results. Scattering is strongly forward-peaked, yielding momentum-transfer cross sections substantially smaller than commonly assumed: mass-scaling from O/C--CO$_2$ systems overestimates H--CO$_2$ total cross sections by factors of 30--45, while existing empirical fits underestimate the low-energy regime by up to $\\sim$45\\%. Isotopic substitution (H/D) produces energy-dependent differences of up to 35\\% at $E<0.1$~eV, invalidating uniform scaling approaches for D/H fractionation. Maxwellian-averaged rate coefficients derived from our cross sections are significantly smaller than mass-scaled values, implying reduced H--CO$_2$ energy transfer efficiency. In atmospheric escape modelling, these revisions can shift Martian exobase altitudes by 10--20~km, leading to order-unity changes in thermal escape rates, and have implications for hydrogen loss in early CO$_2$-dominated planetary atmospheres. Our results provide essential quantum-mechanical inputs for revisiting atmospheric evolution scenarios on Mars, early Earth, and CO$_2$-rich exoplanets."}
