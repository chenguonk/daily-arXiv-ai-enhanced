We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with\nwell-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at\nleast one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane,\nthe two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at\nsystematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a\nresult that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar\nproperties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average\nradius enhancement of $17 \\pm 4 \\%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to\nNG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous\nset of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result\nstill relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed\ninflation include boosted envelope accretion, reduced atmospheric loss, or\nvolatile enrichment by giant-planet stirring.

Small\nasteroid 2023 CX1 was detected in space and predicted to impact over Normandy,\nFrance, on 13 February 2023.

The\nrelease of gravitational energy during accretion would have maintained a molten\nsurface layer, forming a magma ocean. Simultaneously, sufficiently massive\nprotoplanets could acquire hydrogen-rich proto-atmospheres by capturing gas\nfrom the protoplanetary disk. Chemical equilibration among the atmosphere,\nmagma ocean, and iron core plays a key role in determining the planet's\ninterior composition. In this study, we investigate terrestrial planet\nformation under such primitive surface conditions. We conduct N-body\nsimulations to model the collisional growth from protoplanets to planets,\ncoupled with chemical equilibrium calculations at each giant impact event,\nwhere surface melting occurs. Our results show that planetary growth proceeds\nthrough a series of giant impacts, and the timing of these impacts relative to\nthe dissipation of disk gas significantly influences the volatile budget. In\nparticular, initial impacts, occurring while nebular gas is still present, can\nlead to excess hydrogen incorporation into the protoplanet's core. Subsequent\nimpacts with hydrogen-poor bodies, after gas dispersal, can dilute this\nhydrogen content. This process allows for the formation of a planet with a\nhydrogen inventory consistent with Earth's current core.

The Deimos surface is\ndark and predominantly backscattering, with a single-scattering albedo (SSA)\nvalue (6.8%-7.5%) comparable to Phobos. The Deimos phase curve shows a strong\nopposition effect due to shadow-hiding, with negligible coherent\nbackscattering. The amplitude and the half-width of the shadow-hiding\nopposition surge were found to be 2.14 +/- 0.14 and 0.065 +/- 0.004,\nrespectively. We found a high porosity of 86% at the top-layer surface,\nconsistent with complex-shaped grains or fractal aggregates, suggesting a thick\ndust layer.

A blue unit on Deimos, located on streamers of the\nequatorial ridge, shows reflectance increases up to 58%, and a spectral slope\ndecrease of 50% in comparison with the average surface. This blue unit may be\ndue to a different texture of the surface between the two units, with finer\ngrain and/or higher porosity. Deimos photometric properties, including SSA,\nopposition surge, and phase integral, are very similar to Phobos. The presence\nof a blue unit on Deimos reinforces the idea that the Martian moons have a\ncommon origin, making the capture of two different bodies with such similar\nproperties unlikely."}

We also simulated an outburst event as an example of a drastic\nincrease in luminosity. Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer\ndisk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined\ncases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances\nextinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the\ninclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion. Besides, heating\ncauses a shift in the snow line for species with freeze-out temperatures below\n50 K, depending on the disk-binary inclination and binary phase. During\noutbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by\n50% on the opposite side in inclined cases. The snow line shift would impact\nall the species considered in the outburst case. Disk heating in binaries\ndepends on stellar properties, orbital phase, and disk local and global\ncharacteristics.

Only massive and retrograde moons (greater than 10 Earth masses) might\nsurvive around HJs during the coplanar excitation. Furthermore, 6\\% of the\noriginal Jupiter-like planet can also form free-floating planets after\nundergoing coplanar excitation, and most of them retain their moons. Our\nresults focus on the fate of the exomoons and provide a clue on where to find\nthe moon for future missions."}

Silicate and\nhydrogen are miscible above $\\sim 4000$K at pressures relevant to sub-Neptune\ninteriors. Using the H$_2$-MgSiO$_3$ phase diagram, we self-consistently couple\nphysics and chemistry to determine the radial extent of the fully miscible\ninterior. Above this region lies the envelope, where hydrogen and silicates are\nimmiscible and exist in both gaseous and melt phases. The binodal surface,\nrepresenting a phase transition, provides a physically/chemically informed\nboundary between a planet's \"interior\" and \"envelope\". We find that young\nsub-Neptunes can store several tens of per cent of their hydrogen mass within\ntheir interiors. As the planet cools, its radius and the binodal surface\ncontract, and the temperature at the binodal drops from $\\sim 4000$K to $\\sim\n3000$K. Since the planet's interior stores hydrogen, its density is lower than\nthat of pure-silicate. Gravitational contraction and thermal evolution lead to\nhydrogen exsolving from the interior into the envelope. This process slows\nplanetary contraction compared to models without miscibility, potentially\nproducing observable signatures in young sub-Neptune populations. At early\ntimes ($\\sim 10$-$100$Myr), the high temperature at the binodal surface results\nin more silicate vapour in the envelope, increasing its mean molecular weight\nand enabling convection inhibition. After $\\sim$Gyr of evolution, most hydrogen\nhas exsolved, and the radii of miscible and immiscible models converge.\nHowever, the internal distribution of hydrogen and silicates remains distinct,\nwith some hydrogen retained in the interior."}
