Table A.1 is available in electronic form (Sect. 7)", "summary": "Protoplanetary disks with inner dust cavities (often referred to as \"transition disks\") are potential signposts of planet formation. We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \\gtrsim 0.01$ at $\\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M > 30$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M < 13$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

The $β$ Pictoris system is a particularly favorable target, as its proximity and directly imaged planets allow for precise astrometric monitoring. We present astrometric constraints on the presence of binary planets and exomoons in the $β$ Pictoris system using archival observations from the GRAVITY interferometer and SPHERE instruments. We calculate these limits by modeling the motion of the two orbiting planets and introducing an additional perturbation to the model that simulates the astrometric motion caused by an exomoon orbiting the planet $β$ Pictoris b. We find that for short orbital periods ($\\approx50$ days), a lunar companion is only allowed if its mass remains below $\\approx 180~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.6~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $3σ$ confidence. At intermediate periods near 300 days, we exclude moons more massive than $\\approx 65~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.2~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $3σ$ confidence. At longer orbital periods, we place the tightest constraints, ruling out any potential exomoon above $\\approx 50~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.15~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $700$ days and $\\approx 30~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.1~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $1,100$ days (both at $3σ$ confidence). These results place the first astrometric constraints on moons and binary planets in the $β$ Pictoris system and demonstrate the sensitivity of interferometric observations for exomoon studies."}

The conventional formula of type II migration generally predicts too rapid inward migration to reconcile with the observed pile-up of gas giant beyond 1 au. Analyzing the recent high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations by Li et al. (2024) and Pan et al. (2025) that show robust outward migration of a gas accreting planet, we here clarify the condition for the outward migration to occur and derive a general semi-analytical formula that can be applied for broad range of planet mass and disk conditions. The striking outward migration is caused by azimuthal asymmetry in corotation torque exerted from cicumplanetary disk regions (connecting to horseshoe flow) that is produced by the planetary gas accretion, while the conventional inward migration model is based on radial asymmetry in the torques from the circumstellar protoplanetry disk. We found that the azimuthal asymmetry dominates and the migration is outward, when the gap depth defined by the surface density reduction factor of $1/(1+K')$ is in the range of $0.03 \\lesssim K' \\lesssim 50$. Using simple models with the new formula, we demonstrate that the outward migration plays an important role in shaping the mass and semimajor axis distribution of gas giants. The concurrent dependence of planets' accretion rate and migration direction on their masses and disk properties potentially reproduces the observed pile-up of exoplanetary gas giants beyond 1 au, although more detailed planet population synthesis calculations are needed in the future."}

Metallic cores fix oxygen fugacities ($f$O$_2$s) of the planets to 5 (Mercury) to 1 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer, orders of magnitude higher than the nebular gas. Their oxidised character is coupled with a lack of volatile elements with respect to the solar nebula. Condensates from a solar gas at different temperatures ($T_0$) have Fe/O (by mass) of 0.93 ($T_0$ = 1250 K) to 0.81 ($T_0$ = 400 K), far lower than that of Earth (1.06). Because the reaction Fe(s) + H2O(g) = FeO(s) + H2(g) proceeds <600 K, temperatures at which most moderately volatile elements (MVEs) have condensed, oxidised planets should be volatile-rich, and vice-versa. That this is not observed suggests that planets did not accrete from equilibrium nebular condensates and/or underwent additional volatile depletion/$f$O$_2$ changes. Indeed, MVEs in small telluric bodies (Moon, Vesta) indicate near equilibrium evaporation/condensation at IW-1 and 1400-1800 K. Volatile-depleted elemental yet near-chondritic isotopes of larger telluric bodies (Earth, Mars) reflect mixing of bodies of variable volatile depletion, overprinted by volatile-undepleted material. From the Cr- and Ti isotopes in the BSE, such undepleted matter has been proposed to be CI chondrites. 6% CI added late to an enstatite chondrite-like proto-Earth would match the Earth. However, because Earth is an end-member in isotopic anomalies of heavier elements, no combination of existing meteorites alone can account for its chemical- and isotopic composition. Instead, the Earth is made partially or essentially entirely from an NC-like missing component. If so, the oxidised-, yet volatile-poor nature of inner solar system bodies, including Earth and Mars, is intrinsic to the NC reservoir."}

Here we test the hypothesis that interstellar ices carried supernova-produced nuclides by searching for a supernova nucleosynthetic fingerprint in aqueous alteration minerals from carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion."}

We constructed a synthetic Hilda population model which includes distributions of orbital properties, sizes, collisional families and colors. We included two color classes corresponding to the Jupiter Trojan populations (Wong & Brown 2017). We applied three distinct populations of sinusoidal light-curves to this same orbit-size-color model: (1) a Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) fit to rotational periods and amplitudes from the Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al. 2009) (2) a super-fast rotator (SFR) population (0-3 hours) and (3) a super-slow rotator (SSR) population (100-1400 hours). Over the ten-year simulated survey, we predict LSST will discover ~33,400 Hildas, a fivefold increase over the known population. Using a multiband Lomb-Scargle Periodogram via Astropy (Price-Whelan et al. 2022) we confidently recover ~46.5% of Hildas in our LCDB-based population, higher than typical in observational searches. This suggests our light-curve population model may differ from the intrinsic population. We find strong biases in light-curve amplitude, with recovery efficiency dropping sharply below 0.1 magnitudes, while biases from rotational period are comparatively weak aside from cadence-related features such as LSST's ~36 minute revisit cadence. ..."}

An efficient and reliable method for prioritizing the most promising targets is therefore essential. In this paper, we propose a novel first-order filter for identifying potentially habitable worlds based on a simple geometric ratio: the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar diameter ($d/D_s$). Using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we demonstrate that the ideal value for this ratio is not constant, but is dependent on the host star's spectral class. We establish a tiered framework of ideal ratios, beginning with $\\approx 108$ for G-type stars (anchored by the Earth-Sun system), and decreasing by a factor of two for K-type ($\\approx 54$) and M-type ($\\approx 27$) stars, respectively. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation, showing that exoplanets whose $d/D_s$ ratios are close to these empirically derived values consistently exhibit high Earth Similarity Index (ESI) scores.

However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems--that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions. This work demonstrates that machine learning can accelerate exoplanet validation while maintaining scientific rigor.

A search of shallower data obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, conducted when components A and B receded from 2.5 to 2.9~au from the Sun, yielded no detections, suggesting that the fragments had either ceased to exist or were not substantially active during this period. The uncertain fate of C/2019 Y4 highlights the challenge in understanding the state of presumably disrupted comets. Our review of six other presumably disrupted long-period comets reveals that negative confirmations were not reported for half of them, leaving their disruption presumptions inconclusive."}

One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants."}

Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O>1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O<1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks."}

Recent studies suggested that only very cold planets, such as Uranus and Neptune, could experience stratification of volatiles in their envelopes, implying that the envelopes of warmer sub-Neptunes instead have fully-miscible compositions. Here, we present ATHENAIA, an interior-atmosphere composition inference framework we leverage to assess the potential for water-hydrogen demixing on the $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}=350$ K planet TOI-270 d, and more broadly for warm sub-Neptunes, using radiative-convective atmosphere models coupled to interior models. We find that the higher temperatures at which hydrogen and water demix in water-rich environments, combined with the shallower adiabatic gradients of water-rich envelopes, open a window for demixing on sub-Neptunes with bulk envelope metallicities of $\\sim 100$ to $700\\times$ solar, compatible with TOI-270 d. Demixing is easier to achieve on more massive and colder planets, but still broadly affects warm (330 to 500 K) metal-rich sub-Neptunes. Therefore, combining atmosphere metallicities with models of fully-miscible envelopes may lead to underestimated bulk envelope metallicities and mass fractions. Further, our modeling of TOI-270 d's envelope and interior reveals that, for a typical internal energy budget $T_\\mathrm{int}$ of 25 K, the envelope-mantle boundary conditions likely preclude the presence of a molten magma ocean. This work encourages a reconsideration of the current paradigm for linking sub-Neptune atmospheres to their interiors and motivates further evolutionary modeling describing the onset of metallicity gradients in sub-Neptune envelopes."}

An alternative is the presence of a third, low-mass planet located between planets b and c, or on an inner orbit relative to planet b -- particularly near a mean-motion resonance with planet b -- which could account for the observed variations. These findings remain tentative, and further RV and photometric observations are essential to better constrain the mass of planet b and to refine the TTV modeling, thereby improving our understanding of the system's dynamical architecture."}

We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\\mathrm{eff} = \\, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories."}
