In a previous\narticle, we applied cross-correlation functions for the first time to JWST\nNIRSpec/G395H observations of exoplanet atmospheres, resulting in a detection\nof CO in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b and a tentative detection of CO\nisotopologues. Here we present an improved version of our cross-correlation\ntechnique and an investigation into how efficient the technique is when\nsearching for other molecules in JWST NIRSpec/G395H data. Our search results in\nthe detection of more molecules via cross-correlations in the atmosphere of\nWASP-39b, including $\\rm H_{2}O$ and $\\rm CO_{2}$, and confirms the CO\ndetection. This result proves that cross-correlations are a robust and\ncomputationally cheap alternative method to search for molecular species in\ntransmission spectra observed with JWST.

We start from\nmatched-filter stacking and derive how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrades\nwith trial orbit mismatch, which leads to a metric tensor on orbital parameter\nspace. The metric defines local Euclidean coordinates in which SNR loss is\nisotropic, and a covariant density that specifies the exact number of trial\norbits needed for a chosen SNR tolerance. We validate the approach with Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF) data, recovering known objects in blind searches that\nstack thousands of images over six years along billions of trial orbits.

Yet, constraining Jupiter's\natmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential non-uniform\ndistribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in\nJupiter's mid-latitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling\nprecipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor\nbeneath the lifting condensation level. A non-uniform water vapor distribution\nemerges in the mid-latitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter\nacross latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at\nthe 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from\nsub-solar to super-solar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies\nand waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential\nvorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water\nvapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics.\nTherefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of\ndensity stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter's\nmid-latitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle\namplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect,\nthereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal\ngradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a super-solar water\nabundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating\ncondensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species\ngenerally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The\nongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the\nnon-uniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with\nlarge-scale dynamics."}

We analyze molecular tomographies\nand model data using the radiative transfer code DiskFit. Results: We directly\nmeasure the altitude above the mid-plane for each observed species. For the\nfirst time, we unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a common molecular\nlayer and measure its thickness: most molecules are located at the same\naltitude versus radius. Beyond CO, as predicted by chemical models, the CN\nemission traces the upper boundary of the molecular layer, whereas the\ndeuterated species (DCN and N2D+) resides below one scale-height. Our best fits\nfrom DiskFit show that most observed transitions in the molecular layer are\nthermalized because their excitation temperature is the same, around 17-20 K.\nConclusions: These long-integration observations clearly reveal a molecular\nlayer predominantly located around 1-2 scale height, at a temperature above the\nCO freeze-out temperature. The deuterated molecules are closer to the mid-plane\nand N2D+ may be a good proxy for the CO snowline.

Inner planet detections around HD 23079, HD 196067, and HD 86226", "comment": "Accepted in A&A", "summary": "Understanding the link between outer giant planets (OGPs) and inner light\nplanets (ILPs) is key to understanding planetary system formation and\narchitecture. The correlation between these two populations of planets is\ndebated both theoretically -- different formation models predict either a\ncorrelation or an anticorrelation -- and observationally. Several recent\nattempts to constrain this correlation have yielded contradictory results, due\nto small-number statistics and heterogeneous samples. We present an ongoing\nlong-term observational effort with CORALIE, HARPS, and ESPRESSO to probe the\nILP occurrence in systems with and without OGP. In this first article of a\nseries, we discuss how, from the design to the observations, we ensured the\nhomogeneity of the samples, both in terms of stellar properties and observing\nstrategy. We also present the first three detections of ILPs in our OGP host\nsample. We find a 8.3 mE planet at 5.75 d around HD 23079, a 10.4 mE planet at\n4.6 d around HD 196067, and we confirm the 7.5 mE planet at 3.98 d around HD\n86226. While a rigorous statistical analysis of our samples will be performed\nin subsequent studies, the relatively low number of detections in our sample\nseems to contradict previous studies that found a strong OGP-ILP correlation."}

However, since the\nwhite dwarf habitable zone resides at 0.01 - 0.1 AU, planets residing there are\nsubject to tidal heating if they have any orbital eccentricity. Previous work\n(Barnes & Heller 2013) identified nearby planetary companions as potential\nroadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions\ncould induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable\nplanet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway\ngreenhouse for even very low values ($e \\sim 10^{-4}$) of the eccentricity of\nthe potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for\ngeneral relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting\nwhite dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse, and demonstrate that for some\nsystem architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary\nhabitability."}

In particular, they provide constraints to distinguish\nbetween smooth disk-driven migration or more dynamically excited system\nevolution pathways. We report the discovery and characterization of a unique\nmulti-planet system hosting three gas giant planets orbiting the post-main\nsequence star TOI-375. The innermost planet, TOI-375 b, was initially detected\nby the TESS mission and then confirmed with photometric follow-up observations\nconducted using MEarth and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements obtained\nwith FEROS and CHIRON. The radial velocity data revealed the presence of two\nadditional planetary candidates, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d. We find that TOI-375\nb is a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of $9.45469 \\pm 0.00002$ days, mass\n$0.745 \\pm 0.053,M_\\mathrm{J}$, radius $0.961 \\pm 0.043, R_\\mathrm{J}$, and\neccentricity $0.087 \\pm 0.042$. The outer two planets, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d,\nare warm-cold and cold Jupiters with orbital periods of $115.5^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$\ndays and $297.9^{+28.9}_{-18.6}$ days, and minimum masses of $2.11 \\pm 0.22,\nM_\\mathrm{J}$ and $1.40 \\pm 0.28, M_\\mathrm{J}$, respectively. In terms of\nformation and overall system architecture, the physical properties of TOI-375 b\nare consistent with the core accretion scenario, while the current\nconfiguration of the system could be explained by both disk-driven and\nhigh-eccentricity migration scenarios. The discovery of TOI-375 as the first\nknown system hosting three or more fully evolved gas giants, with at least one\ntransiting planet, makes it an excellent candidate for testing formation and\nmigration theories."}

Here, we exploit a unique opportunity\nprovided by the background star AS209bkg, which shines through a wide annular\ngap in the AS209 disk, to perform transmission spectrophotometry and directly\nmeasure the extinction from gap material for the first time. By combining new\nVLT/SPHERE and JWST/NIRCam observations with archival HST data from 2005, we\nmodel the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AS209bkg over a 19-year\nbaseline. We find that the SED and its variability are best explained by\nincreasing extinction along the line of sight as AS209bkg approaches the gap\nedge in projection. The extinction is best described by a combination of\nISM-like extinction component and a grey extinction component. This points to\nthe presence of grains in the disk outer gap that are larger than in the ISM.\nWe find that the extinction in the gap at $\\lambda\\sim4.0~\\mu$m is\n$A_{4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ mag, while at H$\\alpha$\n($\\lambda=0.656~\\mu$m), where most searches for accretion signatures take\nplace, the extinction could be as high as $A_\\mathrm{H\\alpha} =\n4.2^{+0.9}_{-1.2}$ mag ($A_V=4.6^{+1.0}_{-1.3}$ mag). This suggests that even\nwide, deep gaps can significantly obscure emission from protoplanets, even\nthose following a hot-start evolutionary model. Our extinction measurements\nhelp reconcile the discrepancy between ALMA-based predictions of planet-disk\ninteractions and the non-detections from sensitive optical and near-infrared\nimaging campaigns."}
