This thesis investigates the proposed Lunar Coordinate Time\n(TCL), derived analogously to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and thus aligned\nwith current IAU proposals. We first formalise the TCL transformation and\nquantify its characteristics from solar system simulations. Next, we compute\nstationary surface-clock drifts caused by gravitational redshift and the Moon's\nchanging orientation parameters, evaluating how accurate atomic clocks deployed\non the surface of the Moon (much like for ESA's proposed NovaMoon mission)\nwould have to be to measure these effects. Finally, we simulate relativistic\nproper time for ESA's Moonlight navigation satellites, identifying average\ndrift and harmonic variations, to better understand the system that will\ncomprise and enable a Lunar PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing)\narchitecture. These kinds of investigations are an essential step toward a\nsustained internationally cooperative operation at the lunar south pole and\nbeyond."}

Abbot"], "title": "Snowball Bistability Vanishes at Moderate Orbital Eccentricity", "comment": "submitted to PSJ", "summary": "Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the\ncomplexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of\ncomplex life on exoplanets. Sustained stable Snowball episodes require a\nSnowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered\nSnowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate\nbistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the Global\nClimate Model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3.\nThis happens because the Snowball state loses stability as seasonal insolation\nvariations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's\nlarge heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that\nthe Snowball state loses stability as seasonality increases because winter\nfreezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top\ndue to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that\nSnowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars,\nones with longer rotation periods, and disappears entirely for tidally locked\nplanets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as\nrobust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect\nof habitability more consistent with the Rare Earth Hypothesis than the\nCopernican Principle."}

Booth"], "title": "Dust growth and planet formation by disc fragmentation", "comment": "6 pages, 7 figures, accepted and published in MNRAS Letters", "summary": "It is often argued that gravitational instability of realistic protoplanetary\ndiscs is only possible at distances larger than $\\sim 50$ au from the central\nstar, requiring high disc masses and accretion rates, and that therefore disc\nfragmentation results in the production of brown dwarfs rather than gas giant\nplanets. However, the effects of dust growth on opacity can be very significant\nbut have not been taken into account systematically in the models of\nfragmenting discs. We employ dust opacity that depends on both temperature and\nmaximum grain size to evaluate analytically the properties of a critically\nfragmenting protoplanetary disc. We find that dust growth may promote disc\nfragmentation at disc radii as small as $\\sim 30$ au. As a result, the critical\ndisc masses and accretion rates are smaller, and the initial fragment masses\nare in the gas giant planet mass regime. While this suggests that formation of\ngas giant planets by disc fragmentation may be more likely than usually\nbelieved, we caution that numerical models of the process are needed to\nevaluate the effects not taken into account here, e.g., dust grain mobility and\nfragment evolution after disc fragmentation."}

To demonstrate this technique, we apply it to new\nALMA observations of the full complement of hyperfine components from the\n$N=1-0$ transition, achieving a spatial and spectral resolution of\n${\\approx}\\,0.5^{\\prime\\prime}$ and $80~{\\rm m\\,s^{-1}}$, respectively. By\nfitting a model that incorporates the velocity structure of the disk, the\npotential non-LTE excitation of the molecule, and the Zeeman effect, we recover\na radially resolved magnetic field with a strength of ${\\sim}10~{\\rm mG}$\nbetween 60 and 120~au. The morphology of the field is also inferred through\nazimuthal variations in the line broadening, revealing a predominantly poloidal\nfield at 60~au, sharply transitioning to one within the disk plane outside of\nthe gap at 82~au. The signal-to-noise ratio of the data meant that the planar\ncomponent was unable to be decomposed into toroidal and radial components.\nLower limits on the local gas density ($n({\\rm H_2}) \\gtrsim 10^8~{\\rm\ncm^{-3}}$) from the excitation analysis of the CN emission correspond to a\nlower limit between 0.1 and 0.01 for the plasma $\\beta$."}
