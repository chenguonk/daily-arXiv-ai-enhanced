Transit spectroscopy of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has been impacted by the effects of spots and faculae on the host star. Secondary eclipses have detected hot rocks, but evidence for atmospheres has been difficult to obtain. However, there is a third option that we call color phase curves. This method will apply to synchronously rotating non-transiting planets as well as transiting planets. A color phase curve uses photometry at a long-IR wavelength near the peak of the planetary thermal emission (e.g., 21 microns) divided by photometry at a shorter wavelength where the star dominates more strongly (e.g., 12 microns). We avoid wavelengths having potentially strong molecular absorption (e.g., 15 microns) to minimize degeneracies in the color phase curve, and we aim to detect and characterize the planetary atmosphere via its longitudinal heat transfer. The ratio of two wavelengths observed nearly simultaneously is designed to isolate thermal emission from the planet, discriminate against the star, and largely cancel instrumental systematic effects. Moreover, we show that invoking mass-radius relations, and using self-consistent physical models, will permit the longitudinal heat transfer to be measured independent of the orbital inclination. Radial velocity surveys are detecting many new exoplanets, including temperate rocky worlds with Earth-like masses. Most of those planets will not transit, but color phase curves have the potential to detect and characterize their atmospheres."}

In order to maximize the scientific return, we need a well thought strategy for selecting the observational targets, in our case exoplanets. This study evaluates various strategies for selecting exoplanet targets within limited observation windows, focusing specifically on the selection of exoplanet targets for Tier 2 transit spectroscopy with ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. We define three distinct selection criteria -- sample size, variance, and leverage -- and translate them into objective functions compatible with modern optimization algorithms. Specifically, we test five heuristics for maximizing sample leverage: leverage greedy, simulated annealing, K-means clustering, regular classes, and quantile classes. The performance of these methods is demonstrated through three practical exercises across one, two, and three parameters of diversity. Each criterion represents a unique trade-off between sample size, diversity, and total observation time. While a time-greedy approach maximizes the quantity of planets, it fails to capture diversity. Conversely, variance-greedy selection prioritizes diversity but introduces significant drawbacks: it oversamples rare cases and undersamples typical planets, ultimately reducing the total number of targets observed. Leverage-based selections emerge as the most effective middle ground, successfully balancing sample diversity with a robust sample size. This work supports the broader community effort to ensure that Ariel delivers the most diverse and scientifically valuable sample of exoplanet atmospheres within mission limits."}

Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b. Future higher precision observations with JWST may provide better understand constraints on the chemical abundances of oxygen and refractory element abundances to better WASP-33 b's formation and evolutionary pathway."}

We propose the Comprehensive ISO Network (CISON) which combines dual hemisphere wide-field discovery with rapid high resolution characterization and selective escalation to interceptor missions. By coupling this architecture to the differential formulation of the Loeb Scale, ISO classification and risk assessment become predictive rather than reactive.

Grimm"], "title": "Coupled thermal-chemical evolution models of sub-Neptunes reveal atmospheric signatures of their formation location", "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures, in review in ApJ, comments welcome", "summary": "The observed masses and radii of sub-Neptunes can be explained by a variety of bulk compositions, with the two leading scenarios being the gas dwarf and the water world scenario. The evolutionary history of sub-Neptunes on a population level has been proposed as a method to distinguish between the possible bulk compositions. Previous evolutionary models, however, neglected the crucial role of chemical interactions between the atmosphere and interior. We present a novel evolution framework for sub-Neptunes that not only considers the thermal evolution but also takes the chemical coupling of atmosphere and interior into account. Using this model, we examine how planets formed inside and outside the ice line can be observationally distinguished. Young sub-Neptunes store the majority of their volatile budget in the interior, independent of formation location and thus initial composition. Nevertheless, the atmospheric metallicity is a factor 4 higher for the planet formed outside the ice line. As the planet cools, hydrogen and oxygen exsolve from the interior, leading to an increase in atmosphere mass fraction for both planets, counteracting the contraction due to cooling. Consequently, radius evolution alone cannot distinguish sub-Neptunes formed inside the water ice line from water-rich planets formed outside of it. Instead, a key discriminator is the abundance of carbon-bearing species and the resulting atmospheric C/O ratio. For water-rich sub-Neptunes formed outside the \\ice line, almost all carbon is in the gaseous phase. We find that high molar fractions of CH$_4$ ($\\>10^{-2}$) and H$_2$O ($> 5\\times10^{-2}$), and a high C/O ratio $(> 5\\times10^{-1})$ are indicative of formation outside the ice line. In contrast, sub-Neptunes formed inside the ice line exhibit strongly suppressed CH$_4$ abundances, yielding C/O ratios ranging widely from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$. (Shortened version)"}

We performed numerical simulations of a large number of asteroid clones, and we studied their close encounters with Venus and Earth. The asteroid may leave its co-orbital orbit on timescales of 1200 yr. The orbit of 2025 TV$_{10}$ is one of the closest of the absolute minimum of the \"minimum orbital intersection distance\" (MOID) with Earth for the Venus co-orbital asteroids known to date. Owing to its orbital parameters, 2025 TV$_{10}$ represents one of the most dynamically hazardous members of the Venus co-orbital population identified to date. Its faint magnitude and restricted observability windows make future observations challenging but essential for constraining its orbit."}

The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \\pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.2$ km if assuming $p_{V} = 0.04$, as is typical for cometary nuclei in the solar system. This size is in agreement with our estimate derived from the reported nongravitational effect and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\\gtrsim\\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\\sim\\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^\\circ \\pm 1^\\circ$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \\pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \\pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart. From the statistics, we infer that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua."}

We investigated the meteoroids of this shower using fireball data from the European Fireball Network supplemented by video data of faint meteors. We first derived the criteria for assigning meteors to this shower. A fragmentation model was then applied to selected shower fireballs with good deceleration data and light curves. Meteoroid fragmentation strengths and bulk densities were derived and compared with three other showers. We have confirmed the four year periodicity in the activity of eta-Virginids and their presence in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period of four years was directly measured for the fireballs. Fainter meteors showed somewhat longer periods but the shower is poor in faint meteors. No member fainter than magnitude +1 was observed instrumentally. The physical properties of meteoroids are different from cometary streams and are similar to the Geminids. The limiting fragmentation strength of 0.5 MPa and typical bulk density of cm-sized meteoroids of 1500 kg/m3 suggest that the parent body is a carbonaceous asteroid. Besides Geminids, eta-Virginids is another stream of asteroidal origin. Some small meteoroids have densities around 2500 kg/m3. Three asteroids of the sizes between 40 - 120 meters have been found to have similar orbits but their relation to eta-Virginids remains uncertain."}

We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems."}

Our goal is to identify planet candidates that are below the detection threshold set by the SPOC and QLP pipelines using sherlock, a specialized pipeline for robust detection and vetting of transit signals in TESS data. We present the discovery of two inner rocky planets in the TOI-237 and TOI-4336 A systems, confirmed with ground-based photometry from the TRAPPIST, SPECULOOS, ExTrA, and LCO facilities. TOI-237 c has a radius of 1.21 +/- 0.04Re, orbits its mid-M host star every 1.74 days, and is close to a 3:1 mean-motion resonance with TOI-237 b. TOI-4336 A c has a radius of 1.17 +/- 0.06Re, and orbits with a period of 7.58 days an M3.5 host star which is part of a hierarchical triple system. We performed model comparison to search for non-zero eccentricities, and found that the circular transit models are statistically favored. Dynamical simulations show that both systems are in stable configurations, and the TTVs expected for the TOI-237 system are of the order of seconds. TOI-237 c and TOI-4336 A c join the high-interest population of warm likely super-Earths below the so-called \"radius valley\". In particular, TOI-237 c is a good candidate for phase curve observations with JWST/MIRI thanks to the small radius of the host star and its short period."}

This study re-analyzes the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of Kamo`oalewa published by B. N. L. Sharkey et al. (2021), obtained using the Large Binocular Telescope, to infer its mineral composition and space weathering characteristics. Spectral similarity analysis is performed by comparing the spectrum of Kamo`oalewa to the mean spectra of various types in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy to make a preliminary constraint on the combined characteristics of surface mineralogy and space weathering effects. To further characterize the mineral composition, a detailed analysis of the 1 μm band center is conducted based on spectral data below 1.25 μm that have higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical models for normalized spectra are developed to estimate the Is/FeO content. The results suggest that asteroid Kamo`oalewa has higher olivine abundance than that of typical S-type asteroids and the Moon, exhibiting an immature to submature degree of space weathering.

Our 5--28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the $ν_2$ band of water at 5.8--7.0 microns. the primary $ν_2$ and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma.

High-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities allowed us to constrain the planetary masses and investigate their potential compositions. The TOI-4336 A system is composed of a sub-Neptune with a period of 16.34 days, a radius of $2.14 \\pm 0.08$ Re, and a mass of $3.33 \\pm 0.36$ Me, along with an inner super-Earth on a 7.59-day orbit with a radius of $1.25 \\pm 0.07$ Re and a mass of $1.55 \\pm 0.13$ Me.

Their masses are measured to be $7.3 \\pm 1.3$ Me and $4.8 \\pm 1.4$ Me, respectively. The RVs also reveal a planet candidate around TOI-4342, likely non-transiting, with a period of 47.5 days and a minimum mass of $17.8 \\pm 3.0$ Me.

All four planets are excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization with JWST, and their multi-planet nature makes them especially interesting for comparative planetology.
