HIP 33609 b is a highly eccentric, 68 $M_{\\rm J}$ brown dwarf orbiting\na 10,300 K, A-type star with an orbital period of 39 days. Its host star is a\nknown member of the 150 Myr old MELANGE-6 moving group, making it an excellent\nlaboratory for testing sub-stellar evolutionary models. Using in-transit\nspectra collected by the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan II\nClay 6.5 m telescope, we measured a sky-projected orbital obliquity of\n$|\\lambda|= 12.7 \\pm 1.3${\\deg}. The mass of the brown dwarf is most consistent\nwith a stellar-like fragmentation formation history followed by a period of\nmigration. Given the high eccentricity ($e=0.557$) but low orbital obliquity of\nthe brown dwarf, we claim that coplanar high eccentricity tidal migration seems\nto be the most plausible pathway, however, it remains difficult to conclusively\nrule out other migration mechanisms. The low orbital obliquity for HIP 33609 is\nconsistent with previous measurements of high mass-ratio companions, and bears\na striking resemblance to the obliquity distribution of transiting warm\nJupiters. We suggest brown dwarfs may follow a dynamically quiescent migration\npathway, consistent with them forming in isolated conditions."}

Towards Reliably Getting $5\\times$ More Science from Exoplanet Transit Data", "comment": "13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. In review, comments are welcome", "summary": "Exoplanetary science heavily relies on transit depth ($D$) measurements. Yet,\nas instrumental precision increases, the uncertainty on $D$ appears to\nincreasingly drift from expectations driven solely by photon-noise. Here we\ncharacterize this shortfall (the Transit-Depth Precision Problem, TDPP), by\ndefining an amplification factor, $A$, quantifying the discrepancy between the\nmeasured transit-depth uncertainty and the measured baseline scatter on a same\ntime bin size. While in theory $A$ should be $\\sim\\sqrt{3}$, we find that it\ncan reach values $\\gtrsim$10 notably due to correlations between $D$ and the\nlimb-darkening coefficients (LDCs). This means that (1) the performance of\ntransit-based exoplanet studies (e.g., atmospheric studies) can be\nsubstantially improved with reliable priors on LDCs and (2) low-fidelity priors\non the LDCs can yield substantial biases on $D$--potentially affecting\natmospheric studies due to the wavelength-dependence of such biases. For the\nsame reason, biases may emerge on stellar-density and\nplanet-shape/limb-asymmetry measurements. With current photometric precisions,\nwe recommend using a 3$^{\\rm rd}$-order polynomial law and a 4$^{\\rm th}$-order\nnon-linear law, as they provide an optimal compromise between bias and $A$,\nwhile testing the fidelity for each parametrization. While their use combined\nwith existing LDC priors (10-20% uncertainty) currently implies $A\\sim10$, we\nshow that targeted improvements to limb-darkening models can bring $A$ down to\n$\\sim2$. Improving stellar models and transit-fitting practices is thus\nessential to fully exploit transit datasets, and reliably increasing their\nscientific yield by $5\\times$, thereby enabling the same science with up to\n$25\\times$ fewer transits."}

To predict the line\nemission intensity during the formation phase, we wish to follow the\nconsequences of angular momentum conservation of the material accreting onto a\ngas giant in a protoplanetary disc. We focus on the limiting case that\nmagnetospheric accretion does not occur, which yields a conservative estimate\nof the line emission and might correspond to certain epochs during formation.\nWe extend but simplify an existing analytical description of the\nmultidimensional gas flow onto an accreting gas giant, the ballistic infall\nmodel, and combine this with detailed shock emission models. Applying this to\ndata from a global planet formation model, we confirm that the line-emitting\naccretion rate is a minuscule fraction of the gas inflow into the Hill sphere.\nAlso, forming planets are mostly fainter than PDS 70 b and c or WISPIT 2 b,\nwith a maximum H alpha line luminosity Lline near 1e-7 Lsol, roughly\nindependent of planet mass. Most surveys have not been sensitive to such faint\nplanets. Other hydrogen lines in the NIR are fainter by 1--2 dex. This implies\nthat accreting planets are fainter than from past estimates, such that the\nnon-detections are not as constraining as thought. Accreting super-Jupiters may\nwell be present, and a deeper look and closer in to the host stars could well\nreveal many forming planets."}

New interior models of Uranus and Neptune", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models\nfor planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous\nresearch that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical\nprofiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated\ndensity profiles, we apply an iterative algorithm that converges toward models\nthat simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed\ngravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally\nconsistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide\nrange of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both\nwater-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios\nbetween 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain\nconvective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that\nremain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This\noffers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic\nfields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a\nhigher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus\n(0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is\nlikely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper\nlimits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) vs. 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the\ndynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge\nthe conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as \"ice giants\" and\nunderscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to\nbreak compositional degeneracy."}

We aim to confirm and measure the mass of the transiting planet\ncandidate around the K5V star TOI-2093, previously announced by the Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) project. Methods.

Our data indicate that TOI-2093 is\na main-sequence star located at a distance of 83 pc, with solar metallicity,\nand a rotation period of 43.8 +- 1.8 d. Results. We have confirmed the\nplanetary nature of the TESS transiting planet candidate, named TOI-2093 c,\nthrough the detection of its Keplerian signal in the spectroscopic data. We\nmeasured a planetary radius of 2.30 +- 0.12 Rearth, a Neptune-like mass of 15.8\n+- 3.7 Mearth, and an orbital period of 53.81149 +- 0.00017 d. This makes\nTOI-2093 c the smallest exoplanet known in the habitable zone of a\nmain-sequence FGK star. Given its size and relatively high density, TOI-2093 c\nbelongs to a class of planets with no analog in the Solar System. In addition,\nthe CARMENES data revealed the presence of a second planet candidate with a\nminimum mass of 10.6 +- 2.5 Mearth and an orbital period of 12.836 +- 0.021 d.\nThis inner planet, which we designated TOI-2093 b, shows no detectable\nphotometric transit in the TESS light curves.

These efforts have yielded conflicting findings\nregarding the presence or absence of lightning in Venus's atmosphere. In this\nstudy we adopt an indirect approach to constrain the prevalence of lightning on\nVenus, using the chemical by-products it produces in Venus's atmosphere. Nitric\noxide (NO) is a key tracer species of lightning, being exclusively generated by\nlightning in Venus's lower atmosphere. By calculating the present rate of\natmospheric destruction of NO in Venus's atmosphere through\nphotochemical-kinetic modelling, we constrain the lightning power required to\nsustain the estimated NO abundances on modern Venus. The reported NO\nconstraints require lightning to generate at-least three times the power\nreleased on Earth; consistent with either a higher rate of strikes, or greater\nenergy per strike, or a combination of both. Limited detections of optical\nflashes within the clouds could point to lightning striking deeper in the\natmosphere and nearer the surface -- with the result that its optical flashes\nare obscured by the clouds -- driven by triboelectric charging during volcanic\neruptions or wind interactions with surface sediments. Our findings underscore\nthe importance for future missions of confirming lightning on Venus, either by\nverifying the below-cloud NO abundance, or by detecting another unambiguous\nlightning signature, to provide the first definitive evidence of lightning on a\nrocky planet other than Earth."}
