Transit timing has revealed a few systems with\napparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light\ntravel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings\nwith precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three\nreported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4,\nthe period change is best explained by LTTE due to a 10-Jupiter-mass companion\nat 4 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the\ndata firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658,\nspectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the \"planet\" to be an eclipsing\nK/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed\nperiod change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently\nshows compelling evidence for orbital decay."}

A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape\nfrom planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have\nsignificantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler\nstars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is\nrepresentative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this\nquestion, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from\ngas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation\nenvironments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets\nin an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using\nPalomar/WIRC. We report strong ($>3\\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape\nfor WASP-12~b and WASP-180~A~b, tentative ($>2\\sigma$) detections for WASP-93~b\nand HAT-P-8~b, and non-detections for WASP-103~b and KELT-7~b. We fit these\nmeasurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss\nrates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an\nupdated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our\nresults indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be\nexplained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and\ndisfavors NUV-driven escape models."}

If a growing rocky planet acquires enough mass\nprior to the dissipation of the nebular gas disk, it can gravitationally\ncapture a `primary' atmosphere dominated by H2. At the same time, these young,\nrocky bodies are likely to have partial or global magma oceans as a result of\nthe heat from accretion, core formation and radioactive decay of short-lived\nmajor element isotopes. During this magma ocean stage, the dissolution of\nvolatile, life-essential elements, such as hydrogen in the form of water or H2,\ninto the magma is critical in determining the extent to which a rocky planet\ncan maintain these elements over time. However, our ability to quantify the\namount of hydrogen dissolved in the magma oceans of rocky planets is limited by\nthe lack of experimental constraints on H-bearing species' solubilities at\nrelevant pressure and temperature conditions, including those expected for the\nearly Earth. Here we experimentally determine the solubility of water in\nsilicate melts of various compositions in the Ca-Mg-Al-Si-Fe-O system at a\ntotal pressure of 1 bar and temperatures from 1673-1823 K, synthesized in a\nH2-CO2 gas-mixing furnace. We use Bayesian parameter estimation to derive a\nrobust water solubility law that includes the effects of melt composition and\ntemperature. Using this solubility law, we estimate that ~100 ppm of hydrogen\ncan dissolve into a 1 MEarth planet with a surface pressure of ~300 bars set by\naccretion of solar-like nebular gas. For rocky planets in general, ingassing of\na primary atmosphere may be an important source and initial storage mechanism\nfor hydrogen-bearing species in a planet's interior, provided it grew to a\nsufficient mass within the lifetime of the solar nebula."}

Our goal is to determine the physical\nparameters of Oersted by combining multi-chord occultation timing, sparse\noptical photometry, and thermal infrared observations. Such asteroids\n(size$\\sim$20 km) are rarely modeled in this detail due to observational\nlimitations, making Oersted a valuable case study. We applied convex lightcurve\ninversion to sparse photometric data to derive an initial shape and spin state.\nThis model was then refined and scaled using non-convex shape modeling with the\nADAM algorithm, incorporating constraints from the occultation chord profile.\nThermophysical modeling based on WISE thermal infrared fluxes was used to\ndetermine the asteroid's effective diameter, geometric albedo, and thermal\ninertia. The non-convex shape model reveals localized surface concavities and\nprovides a size estimate consistent with radiometric measurements. The derived\nthermal inertia is typical for asteroids of comparable size. This work\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of combining stellar occultations, photometry,\nand thermal infrared data for asteroid modeling and highlights the valuable\ncontributions of citizen scientists, who played a key role in capturing the\noccultation and constraining the asteroid's profile."}

These\nplanets offer unique observational opportunities through transit photometry,\ntransmission spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) phase curve analysis, which reveal\ninformation about heat redistribution and atmospheric dynamics.\n  Complementary to common generalized circulation models (GCMs), we introduce a\nmore comprehensive approach using the anelastic fluid equations that fully\ncapture the three-dimensional nature of the emerging non-linear flows. We\nidentify various non-linear flow regimes and analyze the heat distribution when\nirradiation and thermal advection reach equilibrium.\n  Eastward zonal winds can reach velocities comparable to the planetary\nrotation (up to several kilometers per second), while slower radial flows,\nthough less prominent, contribute significantly to heat advection and can cause\nboth eastward and westward hotspot shifts. The efficiency of day-to-night heat\nredistribution and the positioning of brightness maxima are shown to depend\nstrongly on pressure and the interplay of advective and radiative processes.\n  These findings improve our understanding of the diversity observed in the IR\nphase curves and suggest a non-magnetic mechanism for retrograde hotspot\nshifts.

Application to the Formation of Gullies", "comment": null, "summary": "The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of\n(sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook\nkey processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the\nnon-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the\nparticular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate\nsimulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years\n(obliquity $\\le$35\\textdegree)), beyond the estimated period of gully\nformation. We find that surface melting is impossible anywhere due to\nsublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep\nto reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which\nseasonal CO$_2$ frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the\nunderlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating.
