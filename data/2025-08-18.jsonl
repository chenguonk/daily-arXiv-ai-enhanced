Templates are assumed to approximate the true spectrum\nwhen constructed from many observations or in the high signal-to-noise limit.\nWe develop a numerical simulation that generates SPIRou-like pRV observations\nfrom PHOENIX spectra, constructs empirical templates, and estimates radial\nvelocities. This simulation solely considers photon noise and evaluates when\nempirical templates remain reliable for pRV analysis. Our results reveal a\npreviously unrecognized noise source in templates, establishing a fundamental\nfloor for template-based pRV measurements. We find that templates inherently\ninclude distortions in stellar line shapes due to imperfect interpolation at\nthe detector's sampling resolution. The magnitude of this interpolation error\ndepends on sampling resolution and RV content. Consequently, while stars with a\nhigher RV content, such as cooler M-dwarfs are expected to yield lower RV\nuncertainties, their dense spectral features can amplify interpolation errors,\npotentially biasing RV estimates. For a typical M4V star, SPIRou's spectral and\nsampling resolution imposes an RV uncertainty floor of 0.5-0.8 m/s, independent\nof the star's magnitude or the telescope's aperture. These findings reveal a\nlimitation of template-based pRV methods, underscoring the need for improved\nspectral modeling and better-than-Nyquist detector sampling to reach the next\nlevel of RV precision."}

This shift is theorized due\nto the onset of strong optical absorbers like metal oxides (e.g., TiO, VO),\nmetal hydrides (e.g. FeH), atomic species (e.g., Fe, Ti), and ions (e.g.,\nH$^-$). High-resolution spectroscopy is valuable for characterizing the\nthermal, chemical, and dynamical atmospheric structures due to its sensitivity\nto detailed spectral line shapes. The newly commissioned WINERED\nhigh-resolution spectrograph ($R\\sim68,000$) on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m\ntelescope enhances capabilities with its high throughput in the J-band\n(1.13-1.35 $\\mu$m), capturing strong spectral features from key atmospheric\nspecies. In this study, we report detecting the dayside atmosphere of the UHJ\nWASP-189 b at a $S/N\\sim10$, marking the first exoplanet atmosphere detection\nin emission with WINERED. Individually, we identify strong neutral iron (Fe)\nemission lines at a $S/N=6.3$, and tentatively detect neutral magnesium (Mg)\nand silicon (Si) at a $S/N>4$. Although not individually detected, we detect a\ncombined set of trace species at a $S/N=7.2$, which is attributed mostly to\nneutral chromium (Cr) and aluminum (Al), alongside magnesium and silicon. These\nresults help refine the understanding of key atmospheric species that influence\nthe thermal structure of WASP-189 b and UHJs more broadly."}

Recent ALMA\nobservations of 2MJ1612 show a mildly inclined disk ($i$=37$^\\circ$) with a\nlarge dust-depleted gap (R$_\\text{cav}\\approx$0.4\" or 53 au). We present\nhigh-contrast H$\\alpha$ observations from MagAO-X on the 6.5m Magellan\nTelescope and new high resolution sub-mm dust continuum observations with ALMA\nof 2MJ1612. On both 2025 April 13 and 16, we recovered a point source with\nH$\\alpha$ excess with SNR $\\gtrsim$5 within the disk gap in our MagAO-X Angular\nand Spectral Differential (ASDI) images at a separation of 141.96$\\pm$2.10 mas\n(23.45$\\pm$0.29 au deprojected) from the star and position angle (PA)=\n159.00$\\pm$0.55$^\\circ$. Furthermore, this H$\\alpha$ source is within close\nproximity to a K band point source in SPHERE/IRDIS observation taken on 2023\nJuly 21 \\citep{sphere2025sub}. The astrometric offset between the K band and\nH$\\alpha$ source can be explained by orbital motion of a bound companion. Thus\nour observations can be best explained by the discovery of an accreting\nprotoplanet, 2MJ1612 b, with an estimated mass of 4$M_\\text{Jup}$ and H$\\alpha$\nline flux ranging from (29.7 $\\pm$7.5)$\\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ to\n(8.2$\\pm$3.4)$\\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. 2MJ1612 b is likely the third\nexample of an accreting H$\\alpha$ protoplanet responsible for carving the gap\nin its host disk, joining PDS 70b and c. Further study is necessary to confirm\nand characterize this protoplanet candidate and to identify any additional\nprotoplanets that may also play a role in shaping the gap."}
