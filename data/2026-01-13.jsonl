In this context, we aim to understand how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape, and develop techniques to identify potentially Earth-like worlds. Using the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we can use transit spectroscopy observations to determine what processes drive the evolution of exoplanets, how well can small exoplanets retain atmospheres, and search for Earth-like atmospheres. We advocate the development of a UV spectrograph that is capable of moderate- to high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources, access to key spectral features between 1000 and 3000 Angstrom, and UV detectors that are resilient to high count rates."}

Accepted for publication in CMDA", "summary": "Multi-revolution elliptic Halo (ME-Halo) orbits are a special class of symmetric and periodic solutions within the framework of the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). During a single period, an M:N ME-Halo orbit completes $M$ revolutions around a libration point and the primaries revolve N times around each other. Owing to the repeated configurations, ME-Halo orbits hold great promise as nominal trajectories for space mission design. However, a major challenge associated with ME-Halo orbits lies in their mathematical description. To this end, we propose a novel method to derive high-order analytical expansions of ME-Halo orbits in the ERTBP by introducing two correction terms into the equations of motion in the y- and z-directions. Specifically, both the coordinate variables and correction terms are expanded as power series in terms of the primary eccentricity, the in-plane amplitude, and the out-of-plane amplitude. High-order approximations are constructed using a perturbation method, and their accuracy is validated through numerical analysis. Due to the inherent symmetry, ME-Halo orbits can be classified into four distinct families: southern/northern and periapsis/apoapsis groups. The analytical approximations developed in this study not only provide high-accuracy initial guesses for the numerical computation of ME-Halo orbits, but also offer new insights into the dynamical environment near collinear libration points in the ERTBP, thereby advancing practical applications in mission design."}

The new imaging spectrophotometry is dominated by spatially resolved features due to dust scattered-light and thermal emission plus gas-emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um). The CO2 gas-coma continues to be extended out to a 3 arcmin radius. The continuum spectral signature of H2O-ice absorption has mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered-light plus thermal-emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains while the H2O gas-emission is 20 times brighter. All but the organics-gas comae are circularly symmetric, while a weak pear-shaped solar-pointing dust tail consistent with large dust grains is now present. The new appearance of CN and C-H features suggests that these species are contained either in H2O phases or were trapped under them."}

II. Numerical simulations of the 1/3 spin-orbit resonance confinement and applications to Chariklo", "comment": "26 pages, 26 figures. Accepted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Rings have been found around Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar, three small objects of the Solar System. All these rings are observed near the second-order spin-orbit resonances (SORs) 1/3 or 5/7 with the central body, suggesting an active confinement mechanism by these resonances. Our goal is to understand how collisional rings can be confined near second-order SORs in spite of the fact that they force self-intersecting streamlines.We use full 3D numerical simulations that treat rings of inelastically colliding particles orbiting non-axisymmetric central bodies, characterized by a dimensionless mass anomaly parameter mu. While most of our simulations ignore self-gravity, a few runs include gravitational interactions between particles, providing preliminary results on the effect of self-gravity on the ring confinement. The 1/3 SOR can confine ring material, by transferring the forced resonant mode into free Lindblad modes. We derive a criterion ensuring that the 1/3 SOR counteracts viscous spreading. Assuming meter-sized ring particles, and tau~1, this requires a threshold value mu > 1e-3 in Chariklo's case. The confinement is not permanent as a slow outward leakage of particles is observed in our simulations. This leakage can be halted by an outside moonlet with a mass of ~1e-7 - 1e-6 relative to Chariklo, corresponding to subkilometer-sized objects. With self-gravity, the ring viscosity nu increases by a factor of few in low-tau rings due to gravitational encounters. For large tau, self-gravity wakes enhance nu by a factor of ~100 compared to a non-gravitating ring, requiring ~10-fold larger mu since the threshold value increases proportional to square-root of nu."}

Tidal heating on these shortest-period planets is more than skin deep. We show how orbital eccentricities of just a few percent (within current observed bounds and maintained secularly by exterior companions) can create deep magma oceans. ``Lava tidal waves'' slosh across these oceans; we compute the multi-modal response of the ocean to tidal forcing, subject to a coastline at the day-night terminator and a parameterized viscous drag. Wave interference produces a dayside heat map that is spatially irregular and highly time-variable; hotspots can wander both east and west of the substellar point, and thermal light curves can vary and spike aperiodically, from orbit to orbit and within an orbit. Heat deposited by tides is removed in steady state by a combination of fluid, mushy, and solid-state convection in the mantle. For Earth-sized planets with sub-day periods, the entire mantle may be tidally liquified."}

Some models invoke thick greenhouse atmospheres to produce continuously warm conditions, but others have argued that available geologic evidence is more consistent with short-duration and transient warming events on an otherwise cold Mars. One possibility of harmonizing these perspectives is that early Mars experienced climate limit cycles that caused the climate to oscillate between short periods of warmth and prolonged periods of glaciation, due to modulation of greenhouse warming by the carbonate-silicate cycle. This study suggests that episodic limit cycling during the Noachian and Hesperian periods provides a hypothetical explanation for the timing and formation of fluvial features on Mars. A schematic time-forward trajectory of the full history of Mars is calculated using an energy balance climate model, which includes an active carbonate-silicate cycle, instellation changes due to the sun's main sequence evolution, variations in the obliquity of Mars, and supplemental warming from additional greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide alone. These calculations demonstrate the viability of a climate history for Mars involving episodic limit cycling to enable the formation of the valley networks at 4.1-3.5 Ga and delta features at 3.3-3.0 Ga, interspersed with cold stable climates and ending in the late Amazonian in a carbon dioxide condensation regime. This schematic climate trajectory provide a plausible narrative that remains consistent with available geologic data, and further exploration of warming mechanisms for the climate of Mars should consider the possibility of episodic transient events driven by carbonate-silicate limit cycling."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We report the confirmation of three transiting exoplanets orbiting TOI-1243 (LSPM~J0902+7138), TOI-4529 (G~2--21), and TOI-5388 (Wolf~346) that were initially detected by TESS through ground-based photometry and radial velocity follow-up measurements with CARMENES. The planets present short orbital periods of $4.65$, $5.88$, and $2.59$ days, and they orbit early-M dwarfs (M2.0V, M1.5V, and M3.0V, respectively). We were able to precisely determine the radius of all three planets with a precision of $< 7\\, \\%$, the mass of TOI-1243 b with a precision of $19\\, \\%$, and upper mass limits for TOI-4529 b and TOI-5388 b. The radius of TOI-1243 b is $2.33\\pm0.12\\, {R_{\\oplus}}$, its mass is $7.7 \\pm 1.5\\,{M_{\\oplus}}$, and the mean density is $0.61 \\pm 0.15 \\, {ρ_\\oplus}$.

While TOI-5388 b is most probably rocky, given its Earth-like radius, TOI-1243 b and TOI-4529 b are located in a highly degenerate region in the mass-radius space. TOI-4529 b appears to lean toward a water-world composition. TOI-1243 b has enough mass to host a significant H-He envelope, although a water-world and pure rocky compositions are also consistent with the data. Our analysis indicates that future atmospheric observations using JWST can aid in determining their real composition. The sample of small planets around M dwarfs is widely used to understand planet formation and composition theories, and our study adds three planets to this sample."}

In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \\COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\\pm$6$\\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds."}

These planets are at the detection limit, where the Kepler detection and vetting pipeline produced unreliable planet candidates. We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline's completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $η_{\\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone."}

The heliocentric distances at which the disruptions typically occur are tens of solar radii, which is too far from the Sun for asteroids to be destroyed by sublimation and tidal disruption. The typical disruption distance also appears to be larger for darker asteroids. Here, by carrying out irradiance experiments in vacuum that replicate the conditions in the near-Sun environment, we show that CI meteorite simulants are destroyed within minutes when exposed to the level of solar irradiance encountered at heliocentric distances of up to about 0.2 au. Our results provide an explanation for the scarcity of dark, carbonaceous asteroids with perihelion distances less than 0.2 au, and for the observed mass-loss rate of the asteroid-like object 322P/SOHO~1 assuming its composition is similar to CI carbonaceous chondrites."}
