TL;DR: 通过行星际天体飞越破坏平均运动共振链，解释了紧凑系外行星系统的形成机制，需要至少0.04地球质量的行星际天体储库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑系外行星系统如何从初始的共振链状态演化到当前的非共振构型，验证"打破链条"假说。

Method: 使用N体模拟和半解析计算，分析行星际天体飞越对平均运动共振链的破坏作用。

Result: 发现需要至少0.04地球质量的行星际天体储库才能破坏共振链，且系统在最后一次飞越后约1亿年内经常不稳定。

Conclusion: 这种机制在具有足够质量储库和有效注入机制的系统中有作用，预测共振内系统与动态活跃外构型之间存在反相关性。

Abstract: The orbital architectures of compact exoplanet systems record their
complicated dynamical histories. Recent research supports the
``breaking-the-chains'' hypothesis, which proposes that compact systems
typically form in chains of mean-motion resonances (MMRs) but subsequently
break out on a $\sim 100$Myr timescale. We investigate a scenario for breaking
the chains through intermittent flybys of planetesimals originating from a
distant reservoir. Using $N$-body simulations and semi-analytical calculations,
we characterize the disruption of MMRs through these flybys. We find a
planetesimal reservoir of total mass $\gtrsim 0.04 M_{\oplus}$ is required to
disrupt MMR chains, depending on the mass distribution and the typical number
of flybys executed by each planetesimal. We verify that systems disrupted in
this way are frequently unstable to close encounters within $\sim 100$Myr of
the final flyby. This mechanism operates in systems with both a sufficiently
massive reservoir and an efficient mechanism for planetesimal injection.
Consequently, we predict an anti-correlation between resonant inner systems and
dynamically active outer configurations.

### [2] [Eccentric discs as a gateway to giant planets outward migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18970)
*Chiara E. Scardoni,Giovanni P. Rosotti,Cathie J. Clarke,Enrico Ragusa,Richard A. Booth*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了行星主导的II型迁移中，迁移方向与行星间隙深度参数K相关：高K值对应向外迁移，低K值对应向内迁移。通过分析外Lindblad共振的扭矩贡献，发现1:2和1:3共振处的表面密度比是决定迁移方向的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解行星主导的II型迁移中向内/向外迁移的驱动机制，以及为什么迁移方向与间隙深度参数K相关。

Method: 使用Fargo3D流体动力学代码进行2D、活行星、长期模拟，研究1-13木星质量行星在盘厚度比0.03-0.1范围内的迁移，分析轨道元素和间隙结构演化，以及外Lindblad共振的扭矩贡献。

Result: 所有行星初始都向内迁移，但足够高K值的行星最终会进入扭矩反转阶段，迁移变为向外，最终停滞。这种行为与外盘偏心增长和间隙结构变化相关。1:2和1:3外Lindblad共振处的表面密度比与迁移方向相关。

Conclusion: 行星主导机制中的向外迁移主要由1:2和1:3共振的相对重要性控制，间隙轮廓在决定迁移方向中起关键作用。

Abstract: Recent studies on planet-dominated Type II migration demonstrated the
presence of a correlation between the direction of planet migration and the
parameter K describing the depth of the planetary gap. It was found that high
(low) value for K correspond to outward (inward) migration. In this paper we
aim at understanding the mechanism driving inward/outward migration and why it
correlates with the gap depth. We performed a suite of 2D, live-planet,
long-term simulations of massive planets migrating in discs with the hydro-code
Fargo3D. We focus on a range of planet masses (1-13 m_J) and disc aspect ratios
(0.03-0.1) and analyze the evolution of orbital elements and gap structure. We
also study the torque contributions from outer Lindblad resonances to
investigate their role in the migration outcome. We find that, while all
planets initially migrate inwards, those with high enough K eventually enter a
phase in which the torque reverses sign and migration becomes outwards, until
eventually stalling. This behavior is associated with eccentricity growth in
the outer disc and changes in the gap structure. We identify the surface
density ratio at the 1:2 and 1:3 outer Lindblad resonances as a key output
diagnostic that correlates with the migration direction. This ratio regulates
the migration for all the cases where the massive planet remains in an almost
circular orbit and the outer gap region exhibits moderate eccentricity. This
characteristic sequence of inward-reversal-outwards-stalling occurs for a
variety of K values and thus further work is required to identify the
simulation input parameters that determine the onset of this sequence. Our
results suggest that outward migration in the planet-dominated regime is
primarily governed by the relative importance of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances
and, therefore, the gap profile plays a crucial role in determining the
direction of migration.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 在TIC118798035系统中发现了三颗凌日巨行星，包括一颗温暖的低密度海王星、一颗温暖的土星和一颗温暖的木星，它们的轨道周期分别为11.5天、22.6天和48.9天。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过TESS任务数据识别凌日候选行星，并利用地面观测确认，研究该多行星系统的物理特性和形成历史。

Method: 使用TESS数据识别凌日候选体，结合FEROS、HARPS和ESPRESSO的径向速度观测，通过N体轨道拟合分析凌星时间变化和径向速度数据。

Result: 发现三颗巨行星：b行星（0.025MJ，0.655RJ，11.5天）、c行星（0.403MJ，0.973RJ，22.6天）、d行星（0.773MJ，0.923RJ，48.9天）。这些行星的金属丰度不完全遵循太阳系巨行星的质量-金属丰度相关性。

Conclusion: TIC118798035是唯一拥有超过两颗半径大于0.5RJ的凌日行星且具有精确轨道和物理特征的系统，适合未来大气研究，其形成历史可能与太阳系有所不同。

Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of three transiting giant
planets in the TIC118798035 system. The three planets were identified as
transiting candidates from data of the TESS mission, and confirmed with
ground-based photometric transit observations along with radial velocity
variations obtained with FEROS, HARPS and ESPRESSO. The three planets present
transit timing variations (TTVs). We performed a N-body orbital fitting to the
TTVs and radial velocities finding that TIC118798035 b is as warm low-density
Neptune with a mass of 0.0250$\pm$0.0023 $M_J$, a radius of 0.655$\pm$0.018
$R_J$, and an orbital period of 11.507 d; TIC118798035 c is a warm Saturn with
a mass of 0.403$\pm$0.024 $M_J$, a radius of 0.973$\pm$0.023 $R_J$, and an
orbital period of 22.564 d; and TIC118798035 d is a warm Jupiter with a mass of
0.773$\pm$0.052 $M_J$, a radius of 0.923$\pm$0.044 $R_J$, and an orbital period
of 48.925 d. The bulk metallicities of the three planets don't fully follow the
mass-metallicity correlation found for the giant planets of the solar system,
which hints at a somewhat different formation history for the planets of the
TIC118798035 system. TIC118798035 is the only system having more than two
transiting planets larger than 0.5 $R_J$ with a precise orbital and physical
characterization, amenable for future atmospheric studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Launching in 2027 and 2029, respectively, Twinkle and Ariel will conduct the
first large-scale homogeneous spectroscopic surveys of the atmospheres of
hundreds of diverse exoplanets. This will fundamentally transition the field to
an era of population-level characterisation. In this pilot study, we aim to
explore possible synergies between Twinkle and Ariel to determine for instance
whether prior Twinkle observations can substantially inform the target
selection and observing strategy of Ariel. This study primarily aims to
encourage further investigation by both consortium communities by showing what
a potential scientific synergy would look like on a promising scientific case
that requires further exploration. For this aim, we select a small subset of
"cool" planets that are also particularly well-suited to be observed by Twinkle
and therefore Ariel. By using representative noise estimates for both missions,
we compute the number of visits required for an observation. Then, we simulate
and retrieve transmission spectra of each target, assuming gaseous,
H2/He-dominated atmospheres and various atmospheric models. For all candidates,
we find that atmospheric parameters are generally retrieved well within 1-sigma
to input values, with Ariel typically achieving tighter constraints. We
demonstrate that for a small subset of cool gaseous planets, exploitable
synergies exist between Twinkle and Ariel observations and Twinkle may very
well provide a vantage point to plan Ariel observations. The true extent of the
potential synergies, far beyond our considered sample, will be determined by
the final target lists. Once Twinkle is operational and its performance is
known, it could reliably inform Ariel's target prioritization and Ariel's
capabilities which are already well-established can help define optimal targets
and observational approaches for Twinkle.

TL;DR: 利用JWST望远镜首次分析小行星(84)Klio在3μm区域的光谱特征，发现其含有层状硅酸盐和可能的碳酸盐，光谱特征与CM2型陨石相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究原始C型小行星的组成对于理解太阳系形成过程中挥发物的分布至关重要，特别是内主带小行星带中的低反照率家族，它们是碳质近地小行星(如龙宫和贝努)的重要来源。

Method: 使用JWST上的NIRSpec仪器测量Klio的红外光谱(0.97-5.10μm)，采用NEATM热模型提取反射光谱，通过高斯拟合分析2.8、3.4和3.9μm区域的谱线特征。

Result: 在2.776±0.001μm处发现层状硅酸盐吸收带，在3.9μm处发现深度为0.020±0.001的碳酸盐吸收带，未检测到3.4μm处的有机物吸收特征。Klio的光谱特征与某些CM2型陨石相似。

Conclusion: Klio小行星含有层状硅酸盐和可能的碳酸盐，其组成与CM2型碳质球粒陨石类似，这为了解太阳系原始物质的分布提供了重要信息。

Abstract: The analysis of the composition of primitive C$-$complex asteroids is
essential to understand the distribution of volatiles in the Solar System since
its formation. Primitive low-albedo families within the inner main asteroid
belt are of particular interest because they are a significant source of
carbonaceous near-Earth asteroids, such as Ryugu and Bennu. This study, part of
the JWST SAMBA3 project (Spectral Analysis of Main Belt Asteroids in the 3
$\mu$m region), report the first spectroscopic analysis of asteroid (84) Klio
in the 3 $\mu$m region, in order to better constrain its composition. We
analysed the infrared (0.97$-$5.10 $\mu$m) Spectrum of Klio measured by the
NIRSpec instrument on board JWST. We used the NEATM thermal model to extract
the reflectance spectrum of the asteroid. Several spectral features were then
analysed in the 2.8, 3.4, and 3.9 $\mu$m regions by different Gaussian fitting.
The Spectrum of Klio shows an absorption band at 2.776 $\pm$ 0.001 $\mu$m that
we attributed to phyllosilicates. We compared the position and shape of the
feature with that observed in primitive materials such as carbonaceous
chondrites and returned samples from Ryugu and Bennu. The position and shape of
the 2.8 $\mu$m band, as well as the presence of a 0.7 $\mu$m band in the
visible, suggest that Klio's spectrum is similar to certain CM2 meteorites. We
observed an absorption band around 3.9 $\mu$m, with a depth of $0.020 \pm
0.001$ that could be attributed to carbonates. We could not clearly detect any
absorption associated with organics at 3.4 $\mu$m.

Conclusion: SKA能够探测到气态巨行星，但需要考虑无线电淬灭效应对目标选择的影响。

Abstract: Radio observations provide a window into a planet's interior and play a
crucial role in studying its atmosphere and surface, key factors to find
potential habitability. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, together with
advances in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), motivates
the search for planetary-scale radio emissions. Here, we employ the radiometric
Bode's law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330
confirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission.
Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses
indicate that a planet's mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance
from Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency.
The random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics,
confirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering
observational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals
detectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA*
deployment. Among these, MASCARA-1 b stands out with a predicted flux of 7.209
mJy at 135.1 MHz, making it an excellent SKA-Low target. Meanwhile, WASP-18 b,
with a flux of 18.638 mJy peaking at 812.9 MHz, is the most promising candidate
for SKA-Mid. These results show that the SKA can detect gas giants, such as
MASCARA-1 b (SNR>400) and WASP-18 b (SNR>4236), within feasible integration
times. Additionally, we identify four candidates (HATS-18 b, WASP-12 b,
WASP-103 b, and WASP-121 b) that are likely affected by radio quenching,
highlighting the importance of considering this effect in target selection for
observation campaigns.
