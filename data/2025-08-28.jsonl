However, their operational lifetimes are strongly\ninfluenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a\nsimplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric\ndensity variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force\nequations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and\ncross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with\nexisting NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the\nimportance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in\npredicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of\nincreasing space debris and mega-constellations."}

The\nimpact of climate change on small meteoroids has already been observed over the\nlast two decades, with documented shifts in their ablation altitudes in the\nmesosphere (~50-85 km) and lower thermosphere (~85-120 km). This study\nevaluates the potential effect of these changes on meteorite-dropping\nfireballs, which typically penetrate the stratosphere (~10-50 km). As a case\nstudy, we simulate the atmospheric entry of the fragile Winchcombe carbonaceous\nchondrite under projected atmospheric conditions for the year 2100 assuming a\nmoderate future emission scenario. Using a semi-empirical fragmentation and\nablation model, we compare the meteoroid's light curve and deceleration under\npresent and future atmospheric density profiles. The results indicate a modest\nvariation of the ablation heights, with the catastrophic fragmentation\noccurring 300 m lower and the luminous flight terminating 190 m higher. The\nabsolute magnitude peak remains unchanged, but the fireball would appear 0.5\ndimmer above ~120 km. The surviving meteorite mass is reduced by only 0.1 g.\nOur findings indicate that century-scale variations in atmospheric density\ncaused by climate change moderately influence bright fireballs and have a\nminimal impact on meteorite survival."}

Through our analysis we deem the\nalternative age of 800 Myr unlikely. Gas is detected both in $^{12}$CO (2-1)\nemission through ALMA Band 6 observations and absorption in Ca II K and H seen\nwith high-resolution UVES spectroscopy. The star exhibits a 12 $\\mu$m\nfractional excess of $7.86^{+0.11}_{-2.27}$, placing it in the transition stage\nbetween protoplanetary and debris discs, at a level comparable to HD 141569.\nOur detection of 1.3 mm emission yields the dust mass of 0.019$\\pm$0.009\n$M_{\\oplus}$ assuming 115 K temperature. Assuming a gas temperature of 20 K,\nthe resulting CO gas mass is (7.86$\\pm$2.05)$\\times$10$^{-5}$ $M_{\\oplus}$. For\na warmer gas of 50 K it increases to (1.62$\\pm$0.17)$\\times$10$^{-4}$\n$M_{\\oplus}$. From the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O non-detections we derive upper\nlimits which suggest this CO gas mass estimate should be treated as a lower\nlimit, because the CO emission might be optically thick. From the analysis of\nUVES spectroscopic data we find variability in the spectrum of HD 44892, in\nboth calcium Ca II K and H lines, which is absent from sodium Na I D1 and D2\nlines, and can be interpreted by transiting circumstellar gas. Through\ncomparison to spectra of nearby stars we exclude the possibility of these\nfeatures being caused by interstellar absorption. Both the dust mass, which is\nwithin an order of magnitude of HD 141569, and the gas mass derived here\nindicate a late gas dispersal stage of the protoplanetary disc."}

Accepted for publication in Astron. Astroph", "summary": "We present the spectral characterization of Jupiter Trojans using data from\nthe Gaia mission DR3 spectral catalog (320 spectra of good quality) and from\nthe literature. Gaia spectrophotometry is available in 16 spectrophotometric\npoints covering the 0.33-1.08 $\\mu$m range. The final dataset includes 519\nTrojans, 291 in the leading swarm (L4) and 228 in the trailing swarm (L5),\nwhich we classified using the Bus-Demeo and Mahlke classification schemes.\n  The Trojan population is dominated by featureless asteroids with red spectral\nslopes belonging to the D-type, and an important fraction ($\\sim$ 40\\%) belong\nto the Z-class (in Mahlke taxonomy), characterized by very red slopes. The L4\nswarm shows a higher spectral variability and a higher amount, by a factor of\n2, of less spectrally red asteroids belonging to the C, P, and X classes,\nmainly associated with families members.\n  Once excluding peculiar families members the two swarms have very similar\naverage slope and albedo values (7.86 $\\pm$ 0.15\\% and 7.35 $\\pm$0.15\\% for the\nL4 and L5 swarms, respectively). This points toward a common origin of the\nbodies of the two swarms, likely from the Transneptunian region. We do not\nobserve a spectral color bi-modality distribution, conversely to the results\npreviously reported in the literature. The spectral slope distribution, peaked\nat 9-11 \\%/1000 \\AA, it is very narrow compared to that of Transneptunian\nobjects (TNOs) or cometary nuclei. Trojans visible spectral slopes match those\nof the less red TNOs, and lack of extremely red and organic rich bodies. We\nsuggest that the Jupiter Trojans might have been captured by Jupiter from the\nCentaurs and scattered disk population, and that the lack of extremely red\nobjects among Trojans is due to removal of the organic-rich crust through the\nsublimation of volatiles and collisions as TNOs migrated inward in the Solar\nSystem."}

We investigate the causes of these dropouts, focusing\nspecifically on energetic protons of ~100 keV and ~1 MeV, using back-tracking\nparticle simulations, a prescribed description of Europa's atmosphere and a\nthree-dimensional single fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of the\nplasma-atmosphere interaction.\n  We investigate the role of magnetic field perturbations resulting from the\ninteraction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma and Europa's atmosphere and\nthe presence of field-aligned electron beams in Europa's wake. We compare the\nsimulated effect of the perturbed fields on the pitch angle distributions of\nthe ion losses to Juno-JEDI measurements. We find that at ~100 keV, field\nperturbations are the dominant factor controlling the distribution of the\nlosses along the flyby, while at ~1 MeV a combination of field perturbations\nand absorption by the surface due to short half bounce periods is required to\nexplain the measured losses. We also find that the effect of charge-exchange\nwith Europa's tenuous atmosphere is weak and absorption by dust in Europa's\nenvironment is negligible.\n  Furthermore, we find that the perturbed magnetic fields which best represent\nthe measurements are those that account for the plasma interaction with a\nsub-/anti-Jovian asymmetric atmosphere, non-uniform ionization of the\natmosphere, and electron beams. This sensitivity to the specific field\nperturbation demonstrates that combining observations and modeling of proton\ndepletions constitute an important tool to probe the electromagnetic field and\natmospheric configurations of Europa."}

The two main\ndifficulties in this regard are the collision/fragmentation and the drift\nbarriers. Numerous solutions have been proposed to overcome these barriers, but\noften need a conjunction of processes to reach the conditions for planetesimal\nformation. We present numerical simulations, in which the protoplanetary disk\nturbulence is fully captured rather than modeled with a turbulent diffusion or\nturbulent viscosity parameter. When the turbulent cascade is taken into\naccount, and in the case of weakly turbulent disks, not only can solid grains\nbe highly concentrated in clusters, but their radial drift can also be slowed\nor even halted. These results open a unique path to planetesimal formation\nstarting at disk canonical dust-to-gas ratio, namely Keplerian turbulence."}
