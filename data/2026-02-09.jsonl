We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \\textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \\textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \\textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$~pc of the average XUV flux, revealing ``hazard zones'' where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability."}

This progress has been driven in large part by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which has given us an unprecedented view of Solar System bodies themselves, and of the structure and chemistry of forming exoplanetary systems. Within our own Solar System, ALMA has enabled the detection of new molecules and isotopologues across moons and comets, as well as placing new constraints on the compositions and histories of small bodies through thermal emission observations. In this article, we highlight some key areas where ALMA has contributed to a deeper understanding of our Solar System's formation and evolution, and place these discoveries in the context of our evolving understanding of protoplanetary disks."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Using real metre-sized asteroid Earth impactors from the last decade, we ask the question: ``If the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) had been operating over the last 10 years, how many imminent impactors would it have observed and discovered pre-impact?'' We feed 216 large impacts detected by global coverage orbital sensors through the LSST Solar System Survey Simulator Sorcha, and find that it would have made 99 observations of 28 unique objects, and discovered one object four days pre-impact. Recently proposed pipeline modifications would increase this discovery number to seven. Scaling our results to take into account the biases of our reference population, we estimate that LSST will discover 12 +/- 3 imminent impactors over its nominal 10 year survey, with an average warning time of 3.5 days. While this is at the low end of previous estimates of 1 - 10 discoveries per year, the significant increase in warning time compared to the current average (9 hours across 11 impactors) will bring significant opportunities for follow-up telescopic observations, deployment of specialised equipment for fireball observations, and planetary defence operations. We also show that the LSST will provide substantial precovery data for impactors discovered by other surveys, instantly lengthening observation arcs and thereby reducing the orbital and impact location uncertainties. In some cases, these observations may also enable the linkage of telescopic observations with observed fireballs post-impact, providing valuable pre-impact astrometric and photometric data. This has significant implications for both asteroid research and planetary defence."}

The nucleus of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak exhibited particularly dramatic rotational changes when near perihelion in 2017 April. Here, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope observations from 2017 December to study the post-perihelion lightcurve of the nucleus and to assess the nucleus size. From both Hubble photometry and non-gravitational acceleration measurements we find a diminutive nucleus with effective radius r = 500+/-100 m. Systematic optical variations are consistent with a two-peaked (i.e., rotationally symmetric) lightcurve with period 0.60+/-0.01 days, substantially different from periods measured earlier in 2017. The spin of the nucleus likely reversed between perihelion in 2017 April and December as a result of the strong outgassing torque. We infer a dimensionless moment arm k = 0.013, about twice the median value in short-period comets. The lightcurve range of 0.4 magnitudes indicates a projected nucleus axis ratio greater than 1.4:1, while the active fraction of the nucleus decreased from 2.4 in 2001 (suggesting augmentation of the gas production by sublimating coma ice grains) to 0.14 in 2017, a result of long-term modification of the surface. We find that the physical lifetime of this small nucleus to spin-up is short compared to the reported 1500 year dynamical time spent in the current orbit. Two limiting reconciliations of this inequality are suggested. The nucleus could be in a state of unusually strong activity, leading us to over-estimate the average mass loss rate and outgassing torque and so to under-estimate the physical lifetime. Alternatively, the nucleus could be the surviving remnant of a once larger body for which outgassing torques were less effective in changing the spin."}

Protoplanetary disks are the birthplace of planets. As such, they set the initial chemical abundances available for planetary atmosphere formation. Thus, studying elemental abundances, molecular compositions, and abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks is key to linking planetary atmospheres to their formation sites. Aims. We aim to derive the sulfur abundance and the C/O ratio in the AB Aur disk using interferometric observations of CS and SO. Methods. New NOEMA observations of CS 3-2 towards AB Aur are presented. We used velocity-integrated intensity maps to determine the inclination and position angles. Keplerian masks were constructed for all observed species to assess the presence of non-Keplerian motions. We use the CS/SO ratio to study the C/O ratio. We compare our present and previous interferometric observations of AB Aur with a NAUTILUS disk model to gain insight into the S elemental abundance and C/O ratio. Results. We derive an observational CS/SO ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.6. Only NAUTILUS models with C/O > 1 can reproduce such ratios. The comparison with models points to strong sulfur depletion, with [S/H]=8e-8, but we note that no single model can simultaneously fit all observed species."}

However, systematics introduced during data reduction can lead to small but significant uncertainties that propagate into atmospheric retrievals, making it essential to assess their impact on inferred properties.\n  We aim to quantify the impact of different JWST/NIRSpec PRISM data-reduction processes as well as the relevance of saturation on the retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b. We also assess whether or not these biases are comparable to those introduced by assumptions made in atmospheric modelling, particularly in the treatment of aerosol extinction.\n  We perform nested-sampling Bayesian retrievals using MultiNest and forward models generated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator. Six independently reduced spectra are analysed, considering both the full wavelength range and versions excluding the saturated region. We further test the effect of including three different cloud-opacity parameterisations.\n  Differences among JWST/NIRSpec data-reduction pipelines lead to substantial variations in retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b, often exceeding one order of magnitude, comparable to uncertainties from modelling assumptions. Excluding the saturated region reduces inter-pipeline dispersion but increases parameter degeneracies. This highlights the need for robust and homogeneous calibration strategies. The results also confirm that JWST data possess the sensitivity required to probe aerosol spectral behaviour, although such constraints remain strongly dependent on the adopted data-reduction strategy."}

The community, now mature and well-organized, responded with a global observational effort. Astrometric measurements, forming the basis for orbital refinement and impact prediction, were a central component of this response. In this paper, we present the astrometric data collected by the international community, from the time of discovery until the object became too faint for all existing observational assets, including JWST. We also discuss the coordination role played by the International Asteroid Warning Network, and the importance of publicly available image archives to enable precovery searches."}
