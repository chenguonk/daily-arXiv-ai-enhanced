TL;DR: 重新评估TRAPPIST-1行星的潮汐加热贡献，提出计算潮汐加热剖面的方法，分析内部结构和轨道偏心率对热预算的影响，预测哪些行星可能具有显著潮汐加热活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着JWST对TRAPPIST-1行星的观测，需要重新评估潮汐加热对这些行星热预算的贡献。JWST热相位曲线可能通过异常高的夜晚温度揭示内源加热，为估算潮汐加热提供机会。

Method: 利用同步旋转行星在低偏心率轨道上的已知公式，提出计算潮汐加热剖面的简单方法。通过计算二阶引力Love数k₂，分析不同内部结构（核心铁含量）和轨道偏心率对潮汐加热的影响，假设亚固相线温度剖面与内部热产生解耦。

Result: T-1b和c的潮汐热通量可能超过木卫一的热通量，主要受偏心率不确定性影响；T-1f到g的潮汐通量低于地球地热通量；T-1d和e的潮汐加热可能主导其热预算，可能驱动强烈的火山和构造活动。

Conclusion: 潮汐加热在TRAPPIST-1系统中不同行星间差异显著：内层行星（b、c）可能具有高可探测的潮汐加热，中间行星（d、e）可能以潮汐加热为主并增强宜居性，外层行星（f-g）潮汐加热较弱。JWST观测可能检测到这些信号。

Abstract: With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io's heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth's geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects.

TL;DR: 超离子H2O冰在冰巨行星内部表现出显著的质子热电效应，温度梯度驱动质子对流产生磁场，解释了天王星和海王星磁场差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天王星和海王星具有异常倾斜和多极磁场，这对解释其内部磁场产生机制构成重大挑战。最近研究证实超离子H2O在它们的冰幔中是热力学稳定的主要相。

Method: 研究超离子H2O冰的质子热电效应，计算天王星和海王星内部的塞贝克系数，分析温度梯度如何诱导质子对流并驱动磁场生成。

Result: 天王星内部最大塞贝克系数约620 uV/K，海王星较低为570-585 uV/K。温度梯度差异可以完全解释两者磁场强度差异，预测值与观测结果一致。

Conclusion: 超离子H2O冰的质子热电效应是冰巨行星磁场生成的新机制，天王星和海王星磁场差异源于内部温度梯度不同，该模型与观测相符。

Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are characterized by anomalously tilted and multi-dipole magnetic fields, which poses substantial challenges for elucidating the internal mechanisms generating magnetic fields. Recent investigations confirmed that superionic H2O is thermodynamically stable and constitutes the dominant H2O phase within their icy mantles. In this study, we demonstrate that the superionic H2O ice exhibits a pronounced protonic thermoelectric effect, in which the maximum Seebeck coefficient within the interior of Uranus can reach approximately 620 uV/K, whereas that of Neptune is lower, within the range of 570-585 uV/K. Consequently, temperature gradients in the icy mantles can induce proton convection, which in turn drives magnetic field generation. Based on this novel mechanism, the disparities in magnetic field strength between Uranus and Neptune can be accounted for exclusively by their differing internal temperature gradients, and the predicted values are in agreement with observations.

TL;DR: 盘碎裂模型不仅能形成大质量伴星，还能产生大量自由漂浮行星，特别是微引力透镜观测到的较小行星，为盘碎裂形成亚木星质量行星提供了有力证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释观测到的多种天体系统（如M矮星周围的巨行星、FGK星的褐矮星伴星、小间距双星）的起源，并扩展该模型来解释微引力透镜发现的更丰富的自由漂浮行星（FFPs）群体。

Method: 采用三种互补的模拟方法：1）研究盘碎裂形成行星的过程；2）分析双星系统重组过程中的动力学相互作用；3）模拟行星从数十天文单位区域的迁移和弹射效率。

Result: 模拟显示，当次星质量超过主星质量约10%时，行星弹射效率高达0.5；而木星质量的行星从数十天文单位区域迁移过快，无法有效弹射该区域的行星。

Conclusion: 微引力透镜观测到的自由漂浮行星可能是盘碎裂形成亚木星质量行星的最有力证据，表明盘碎裂不仅能形成大质量天体，也能产生较小质量的行星。

Abstract: Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic "pincer movement" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\sim 10$\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter.

### [4] [The uncertainty in water mass fraction of wet planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03932)
*Michael Lozovsky*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究使用内部结构模型探索高含水量行星的内部结构，基于水-岩石混溶性标准而非传统分层假设，揭示了水质量分数估计的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球到海王星质量范围内的行星通常含有挥发性物质，表明其内部可能存在丰富的水分，但直接观测水质量分数和分布仍不可行。

Method: 使用内部结构代码MAGRATHEA建模高含水量行星，基于水-岩石混溶性标准确定水和岩石分布，考虑水-岩石不混溶性和水的蒸汽状态。

Result: 在行星外层区域，压力和温度低于水-岩石混溶点，导致水-岩石分离，形成最外层的水壳，揭示了水质量分数估计的不确定性。

Conclusion: 基于水-岩石混溶性的建模方法强调了已探测系外行星水质量分数估计的不确定性，挑战了传统的分层结构假设。

Abstract: Planets with masses between Earth and Neptune often have radii that imply the presence of volatiles, suggesting that water may be abundant in their interiors. However, directly observing the precise water mass fraction and water distribution remains unfeasible. In our study, we employ an internal structure code MAGRATHEA to model planets with high water content and explore potential interior distributions. Departing from traditional assumptions of a layered structure, we determine water and rock distribution based on water-rock miscibility criteria. We model {wet planets} with an iron core and a homogeneous mixture of rock and water above it. At the outer regions of the planet, the pressure and temperature are below the rock-water miscibility point (the second critical point), causing the segregation of water and rock. Consequently, a shell of water is formed in the outermost layers. By considering the water-rock miscibility and the vapor state of water, our approach highlights the uncertainty in estimating the water mass fraction of detected exoplanets.

TL;DR: 该研究首次直接测量了N₂冰在太赫兹-红外波段的复折射率，填补了天体物理模型中氮冰光学性质的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子氮(N₂)是原行星盘中氮的主要储存形式，对氮化学至关重要。然而，缺乏N₂冰在太赫兹-红外波段的光学常数数据，导致辐射传输模型、雪线位置和盘质量估计存在不确定性。

Method: 通过气相沉积在低温硅窗上生长N₂冰，使用太赫兹脉冲光谱(TPS)直接重建太赫兹复折射率，傅里叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)结合Kramers-Kronig关系推导红外响应，并用洛伦兹介电模型参数化和DFT计算验证。

Result: 首次量化了N₂冰在0.3-16 THz(1 mm-18.75 μm)波段的复折射率，发现α-N₂晶体的光学活性声子在1.47和2.13 THz处有共振吸收峰。

Conclusion: 通过结合TPS和FTIR光谱，提供了完整的N₂冰太赫兹-红外光学常数数据集，对原行星盘演化和行星形成的观测与建模研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates.
  Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.
  Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations.
  Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $ν= 0.3$--$16$~THz ($λ= 1$~mm--$18.75~μ$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $ν_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $γ_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $α$-N$_2$ crystal.
  Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解外部光蒸发如何影响恒星团中多行星系统的形成和演化，特别是光蒸发对行星生长、动力学演化和最终行星结构的调控作用。

Method: 使用N体模拟研究多行星通过卵石吸积形成的过程，结合受外部光蒸发影响的1维粘性星盘模型，分析不同初始星盘质量和FUV辐射强度下的行星演化。

Result: 外部光蒸发通过减少卵石质量库抑制行星生长，在低质量星盘(<0.1 M⊙)中效果显著；在高质量星盘中行星间相互作用主导最终行星质量；光蒸发在低质量星盘的行星结构和宽轨道类地行星分布中留下明显特征。

Conclusion: 外部光蒸发是塑造恒星团中多行星系统演化的重要机制，特别是在低质量星盘中能显著抑制行星生长并影响最终行星结构，但在高质量星盘中行星间相互作用可能掩盖光蒸发的影响。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how external photo-evaporation influences the formation, dynamical evolution and the resultant planetary architecture of multi-planet systems born in stellar clusters. We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (< 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (< 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (> 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters.

TL;DR: 分析近地小行星2021 PH27和2025 GN1的关联性，两者具有相似的轨道参数和光谱类型，但不太可能由潮汐瓦解形成，更可能是旋转分裂形成的双星系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究两个具有相似轨道参数和光谱类型的近地小行星是否构成关联对，探索它们的形成机制和演化历史

Method: 1) 光谱测量确认两者均为X型小行星；2) 数值积分轨道回溯10万年，考虑相对论修正；3) 分析飞越金星事件和近日点距离变化；4) 评估潮汐瓦解和旋转分裂的可能性

Result: 1) 两小行星经历了5次相似的金星飞越，但都远在洛希极限之外；2) 近日点距离曾降至0.1-0.08au，但仍远离太阳洛希极限；3) 潮汐瓦解起源可能性低；4) 旋转周期和质量比与已知近地双星系统一致；5) YORP效应可在15±5万年内使2021 PH27自转周期加倍

Conclusion: 这对小行星不太可能由潮汐瓦解形成，更可能是碎石堆小行星因各向异性气体排放或YORP效应导致旋转分裂形成的双星系统，分离时间超过1.05万年，可能在1.7-2.1万年前。碎片可能仍在轨道附近，可能在金星大气中产生流星雨

Abstract: We analyse the association between the NEAs 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1, which share similar heliocentric Keplerian elements and the same taxonomic classification. First, we confirm the spectral similarity by getting independent colours measurements of 2025 GN1 and confirming that they are both X-type. From numerical integration of the orbits up to 100 kyr in the past, taking into account relativistic corrections, we found that the two asteroids experienced five similar flybys with Venus, but none of them were closer than the Roche limit. The perihelion distance also reached values between 0.1 and 0.08 au about 17/21 kyr and 45/48 kyr ago, but still well outside the Roche limit with the Sun. So, the origin of the pair by tidal disruption of a progenitor rubble-pile asteroid appears unlikely. On the other hand, we found periods lasting several thousand years where the perihelion was below 0.1 au, and this can lead to thermal fracturing of the surface. We found that the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio secondary/primary make the pair indistinguishable from the binary systems known among the NEAs, and the YORP effect can double the rotation period of 2021 PH27 in $150 \pm 50$ kyr. So it is plausible that the pair was formed by the rotational disintegration of a rubble-pile asteroid due to anisotropic gas emission or the YORP effect, which formed a binary system that later dissolved due to the internal dynamics of the pair. We are unable to give a value for the separation age; we can only say that it occurred more than 10.5 kyr ago and may have occurred between 17/21 kyr ago during the last and longer phase of lower perihelion distance. In this scenario, little meteoroids released in space due to the fragmentation event are still near the pair's orbit and can generate a meteor shower in Venus' atmosphere.

### [8] [Two-source terrestrial planet formation with a sweeping secular resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04032)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文提出早期内太阳系存在两个主要物质库：1 au内的狭窄富耐火物质环和1 au外氧化态变化的星子盘。通过N体模拟，向内扫动的长期共振将外盘物质聚集到内环，形成火星并为原始地球提供氧化物质，解释了内太阳系氧化和同位素梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统窄环模型能成功再现类地行星轨道结构，但难以解释内太阳系化学结构（从水星到火星的还原-氧化梯度以及小行星带平行梯度）。需要将轨道结构与化学梯度统一起来。

Method: 使用N体模拟，考虑气动阻力和木星土星共振扰动引起的向内扫动长期共振，模拟外星子盘物质向内迁移聚集过程，研究其对行星形成和化学物质分布的影响。

Result: 向内扫动的长期共振能将外盘星子聚集到狭窄环中并径向迁移，形成火星并为原始地球提供氧化物质。未吸积星子可植入小行星带成为陨石母体，最还原物质未被植入，解释了陨石样品缺失。

Conclusion: 该模型在低粘度磁风驱动盘背景下，统一解释了内太阳系氧化和同位素梯度，将轨道结构与化学结构协调一致，为太阳系形成提供了更完整的图景。

Abstract: The models that most successfully reproduce the orbital architecture of the Solar System terrestrial planets start from a narrow annulus of material that grows into embryos and then planets. However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种无需外部扰动体的机制，通过光蒸发在星盘中形成间隙，使内盘快速进动并与海王星尺寸行星的J2进动发生共振，从而激发行星到极轨道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海王星尺寸行星的恒星自旋-轨道角存在对齐和垂直的二分现象，传统模型需要外部扰动体参与共振捕获，但大多数系统中并未确认存在这样的扰动体。

Method: 提出自包含机制：光蒸发在原行星盘约1AU处形成间隙，内盘继续粘性吸积到主星，受外盘扰动快速进动。随着内盘收缩，进动变慢，与海王星J2进动发生共振，快速激发行星到极轨道。

Result: 该机制能够解释小行星（特别是海王星尺寸行星）的轨道倾角，但不适用于质量更大的行星（因其会对星盘产生反作用）。

Conclusion: 光蒸发驱动的共振机制为没有巨扰动体的系统中海王星尺寸行星的极轨道形成提供了自包含的解释，再现了小行星轨道倾角的多个观测特征。

Abstract: The stellar spin-orbit angles of Neptune-sized planets present a primordial yet puzzling view of the planetary formation epoch. The striking dichotomy of aligned and perpendicular orbital configurations are suggestive of obliquity excitation through secular resonance -- a process where the precession of a hot Neptune becomes locked onto a forcing frequency, and is slowly guided into a perpendicular state. Previous models of resonant capture have involved the presence of companion perturbers to the star-planet-disk system, but in most cases, such companions are not confirmed to be present. In this work, we present a mechanism for exciting Neptunes to polar orbits in systems without giant perturbers, where photo-evaporation is the self-contained mechanism. Photo-evaporation opens a gap in the protoplanetary disk at ~1 au, and the inner disk continues to viscously accrete onto the host star, precessing quickly due to the perturbation of the outer disk. As the inner disk shrinks, it precesses more slowly, and encounters a resonance with the J2 precession of the Neptune, quickly exciting it to a polar configuration. While likely not applicable to more massive planets which trigger back-reactions onto the disk, this mechanism reproduces the obliquities of small planets in multiple respects.
