Submitted to AAS journals", "summary": "Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact\nwith the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and\nmagma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST\nobservations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules\nin a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes\nincluding accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere\ninteractions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere\ninteractions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at\nthe atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper\natmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we\npresent a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of\nmagma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which\nmodels reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a\nradiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the\nobservable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the\natmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact\nthe upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec\nobservations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide\na good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This\nsuggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high\nabundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune\natmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the\nprotoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar\ncompositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere\ninteractions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a\nsub-Neptune."}

Here, we propose that close-in,\neccentric terrestrial exoplanets can sustain H$_2$-dominated atmospheres due to\nintense tidally-driven volcanic degassing. We develop an interior-atmosphere\nframework to assess whether volcanic outgassing can sustain \\ch{H2}-dominated\natmospheres over geologic timescales ($\\geq$1 Gyr). We incorporate interior\nredox state, tidal heating, volatile inventory, and planetary parameters to\ncompute outgassing fluxes and confront them with energy-limited hydrodynamic\nescape. We demonstrate that to sustain an H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, a\nterrestrial exoplanet must have a water-rich basal magma ocean and reduced\nmelts, in addition to high eccentricity. We additionally demonstrate that\ndetection of a specifically thin H$_2$-dominated atmosphere is a sign of\ncurrent magmatic outgassing. We delineate an \"outgassing zone\" (OZ) most\nfavorable to the existence of such planets, and identify the most\nobservationally compelling targets. We propose combining precise\nmass-radius-eccentricity measurements with JWST constraints on atmospheric mean\nmolecular mass $\\mu$ to search for thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. Inversely,\nwe argue that robust atmospheric non-detections on OZ exoplanets can constrain\nthe planetary interior, including melt redox state, mantle melt fraction and\nvolatile inventory, and tidal heat flux."}

However, there is growing\nevidence that material transport may be driven by magnetically-driven winds\ninstead. By carrying out a suite of two-dimensional multi-fluid hydrodynamic\nsimulations where wind is implemented with a parameterized model, we explored\nhow dust filtration efficiency and the size of dust grains filtered change in\ndisks where gas accretion is dominated by magnetically-driven winds. We found\nthat the inward gas flow driven by the wind can enable dust to overcome the\npressure bump at the outer gap edge and penetrate the planet-induced gap. The\nmaximum size of dust grains capable of penetrating the gap increasing with the\nwind strength. Notably, we found that when wind is strong (mass loss rate =\n1e-7 M_sun/yr), mm-sized grains can penetrate the gap opened by a\nmulti-Jovian-mass planet. Our results suggest that magnetically driven winds\ncan significantly enhance pebble drift and impact planet formation in the inner\nprotoplanetary disk."}

We refit\nMinor Planet Center astrometry and propagate the full six-parameter covariance\nto survey epochs to define search regions. We build low-threshold source\ncatalogs for viable images and evaluate every detected source in a search\nregion as a candidate prediscovery. We eliminate false positives by refitting a\nnew orbit to each candidate and probabilistically linking detections across\nimages using a likelihood ratio. Applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)\nimaging, we identify approximately 3000 recently discovered NEAs with\nprediscovery potential, including a doubling of the observational arc for about\n500.

Existing\ntheories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single\nmechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of\nthe four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different\nmechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar\nstructures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing\nthe phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and\nsubrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our\nanalysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of\nequatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests\nthat the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more\nbroadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering\na unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns."}

We investigate how\ndifferent interior structure assumptions affect the inferred bulk metallicity\nand its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets\n(0.12-5.98 MJ), we compute evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieve their\nbulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: Core+Envelope (CE),\nDilute Core (DC), and Fully Mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a\nsignificant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (M_Z) and\nplanetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between metallicity (Z) and M\n(also for Z/Z_star vs. M). DC structures yield metallicities comparable to CE\nmodels, regardless of the assumed gradient extent. Increasing atmospheric\nmetallicity raises the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow\nplanetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved\nmetallicity by up to 35%. Sensitivity analyses show that the mass-metallicity\nanti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets, while\nmassive planets exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities. Improved constraints\non convective mixing, combined with upcoming precise measurements of planetary\nmasses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and\nAriel, will enable more robust inferences of interior structures and formation\npathways for gas giant planets."}

Our aim is to demonstrate its capabilities in modeling stellar\nactivity in the context of RV measurements and its effects on transmission\nspectra. To do this, we employed solar observations alongside synthetic spectra\nand compared the resulting simulations. We used SOAPv4 to simulate photospheric\nactive regions and planetary transits for a Sun-like star hosting a hot\nJupiter. By varying the input spectra, we investigated their impact on the\nresulting absorption spectra and compared the corresponding simulations. We\nthen assessed how stellar activity deforms these absorption profiles. Finally,\nwe explored the chromatic signatures of stellar activity across different\nwavelength ranges and discussed how such effects have been employed in the\nliterature to confirm planet detections in radial-velocity measurements. We\npresent the latest updates to SOAP, a tool developed to simulate active regions\non the stellar disk while accounting for wavelength-dependent contrast. This\nfunctionality enables a detailed study of chromatic effects on radial-velocity\nmeasurements. In addition, SOAPv4 models planet-occulted line distortions and\nquantifies the influence of active regions on absorption spectra. Our\nsimulations indicate that granulation can introduce line distortions that mimic\nplanetary absorption features, potentially leading to misinterpretations of\natmospheric dynamics. Furthermore, comparisons with ESPRESSO observations\nsuggest that models incorporating non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects\nprovide an improved match to the absorption spectra of HD 209458 b, although\nthey do not fully reproduce all observed distortions."}

The possible separation of the disk into distinct\nreservoirs and the resulting dust depletion interior to the gap have important\nimplications for planetesimal formation and the chemical and isotopic\ncomposition of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Dust fragmentation,\nhowever, maintains a reservoir of small grains which can traverse the gap. Dust\nevolution models are thus instrumental for studies of a gap's filtration\nefficiency. We present 2D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk\nsystems with dust coagulation and fragmentation. For the first time, we evolve\na series of 2D simulation with dust coagulation over 45000 planetary orbits and\ntrack the dust's size evolution and origin by using the TriPoD dust coagulation\nmethod. We investigate the effects of different planetary masses, fragmentation\nvelocities, and viscosities on the inner disk's dust mass budget and\ncomposition, and highlight the advantages of multi-dimensional simulations over\n1D models. Filtering can only be efficient for high planetary masses, high\nfragmentation velocities, and low diffusivities. Clear compositional\ndistinctions between the inner and outer disk could not have been maintained by\nJupiter's core if the fragmentation velocity was low, even if $\\alpha \\lesssim\n5 \\times 10^{-4}$. Significant \"contamination\" of the inner disk by outer-disk\ndust occurs in much less than $2 \\times 10^5$ yr in this case and even for more\nmassive objects.
