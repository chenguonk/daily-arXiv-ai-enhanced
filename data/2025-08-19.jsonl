Often too plentiful to be\nexplained by an in-situ planetesimal belt, exozodi dust is usually thought to\nbe transported inwards from further out in the system. There is no consensus on\nwhich (if any) of various proposed dynamical models is correct, yet it is vital\nto understand exozodis given the risk they pose to direct imaging and\ncharacterisation of Earth-like planets. This article reviews current\ntheoretical understanding of the origin and evolution of exozodi dust. It also\nidentifies key questions pertinent to the potential for exozodis to impact\nexoplanet imaging and summarises current understanding of the answer to them\ninformed by exozodi theory. These address how exozodi dust is delivered, its\nsize and spatial distribution, and the effect of its composition on exozodi\nobservability, as well as the connection between hot and warm exozodis. Also\naddressed are how common different exozodi levels are and how that level can be\npredicted from system properties, as well as the features that planets impart\nin dust distributions and how exozodis affect a planet's physical properties\nand habitability. We conclude that exozodis present both a problem and an\nopportunity, e.g., by introducing noise that makes planets harder to detect,\nbut also identifying systems in which ingredients conducive to life, like water\nand volatiles, are delivered to the habitable zone."}

The rings consist of a number of small\nparticles, although individual particles have not been directly imaged. Near\nthe central planet, colliding particles bounce off each other in low-velocity\nimpacts but cannot gravitationally merge due to the effect of the tidal force,\nresulting in the formation of rings, whereas in more distant regions particles\ncan gravitationally accrete to form satellites. Rings exhibit various types of\nfine structure, and the mutual gravitational forces between particles and the\ngravity from satellites play an important role in rings of macroscopic\nparticles, while non-gravitational forces are important for dusty rings. There\nare several theories about the origin of rings, and formation mechanisms are\nlikely to be different among different ring systems. The rings of small Solar\nSystem bodies were discovered through observations of occultations of stars by\nthese bodies. It is natural to expect that some exoplanets should also have\nrings, but their detection remains challenging. Future discovery of more\nring-moon systems around small bodies and exoplanets will provide clues to\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of the central bodies that host them."}
