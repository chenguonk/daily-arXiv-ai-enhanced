TL;DR: 对WD 1856+534系统的长期观测显示，其冷木星行星的轨道周期保持恒定，排除了轨道增长的可能性，并限制了行星潮汐质量因子和潜在伴星的存在。

Motivation: 研究WD 1856+534系统中冷木星行星的轨道演化，特别是验证其是否通过高偏心率潮汐迁移机制到达当前位置。

Method: 将观测数据从311个历元扩展到1498个历元，进行新的凌星时间测量，分析轨道周期变化、潮汐质量因子和潜在伴星。

Result: 数据与恒定周期模型一致，未发现轨道增长证据；行星潮汐质量因子Q_p' ≥ 3.1×10^6；排除了质量大于4.1M_J、周期短于1500天的伴星；偏心率上限e<10^-2。

Conclusion: 如果行星确实通过高偏心率潮汐迁移到达当前位置，当前的低偏心率表明迁移过程已停止，未来轨道演化将由弱行星潮汐主导。

Abstract: We present new transit timing measurements for the white dwarf-cold Jupiter system WD 1856+534, extending the baseline of observations from 311 epochs to 1498 epochs. The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\dot{P} = 0.04\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \gtrsim 3.1 \times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.
