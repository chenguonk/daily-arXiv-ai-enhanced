A detailed\ncharacterization of key planets within this population is important for\nunderstanding the formation mechanisms of rocky and gas giant planets and the\ndiversity of planetary interior structures. In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite\nfound a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star\nTOI-283. We started radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations with ESPRESSO\nto obtain a mass measurement. Mass and radius are measurements critical for\nplanetary classification and internal composition modeling. We used ESPRESSO\nspectra to derive the stellar parameters of the planet candidate host star\nTOI-283. We then performed a joint analysis of the photometric and RV data of\nthis star, using Gaussian processes to model the systematic noise present in\nboth datasets. We find that the host is a bright K-type star ($d = 82.4$ pc,\n$\\mathrm{T}_\\mathrm{eff} = 5213 \\pm 70$ K, $V = 10.4$ mag) with a mass and\nradius of $\\mathrm{M}_\\star = 0.80 \\pm 0.01\\; \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and\n$\\mathrm{R}_\\star = 0.85 \\pm 0.03\\; \\mathrm{R}_\\odot$. The planet has an\norbital period of $P = 17.617$ days, a size of $\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{p} = 2.34\n\\pm 0.09\\; \\mathrm{R}_\\oplus$, and a mass of $\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{p} = 6.54 \\pm\n2.04\\; \\mathrm{M}_\\oplus$. With an equilibrium temperature of $\\sim$600 K and a\nbulk density of $\\rho_\\mathrm{p} = 2.81 \\pm 0.93$ g cm$^{-3}$, this planet is\npositioned in the mass-radius diagram where planetary models predict H$_2$O-\nand H/He-rich envelopes. The ESPRESSO RV data also reveal a long-term trend\nthat is probably related to the star's activity cycle. Further RV observations\nare required to confirm whether this signal originates from stellar activity or\nanother planetary body in the system."}

Few spacecrafts\nlanded on the surface and measured winds with amplitudes below 1 m/s. The\ndiurnal cycle of the wind amplitude and orientation is not known. Recent\nnumerical simulations showed that slope winds along topographic structures\ncould strongly impact the direction of winds. This study presents the first\nmesoscale modelling of such winds on Venus. A change of direction is occurring\nduring the day in the main slopes, with upslope winds at noon due to solar\nheating and downslope winds at night. This is due to efficient IR cooling of\nthe surface during the night, being colder than its surroundings slope\natmospheric environment and leading to displacement of air. The temperature is\nimpacted by the adiabatic cooling/warming induced by those winds. A strong\nheating effect is occurring for the downslope winds, leading to an\nanti-correlation between the surface temperature diurnal amplitude and the\ntopography. This diurnal amplitude reaches 4 K in the plains and below 1 K in\nthe mountains. The saltation of sediment by those winds was also quantified,\nwith a higher probability at night along the slopes on the western flanks."}

This paper\ndefines the origin, orientation, and scale of the Lunar Reference System (LRS),\nas well as provides numerical solutions for the first realization of the\nInternational Lunar Reference Frame (ILRF). ILRF is defined as the Principal\nAxis (PA) system, attached to the surface and co-rotating with the Moon, with\nits origin in the lunar center of mass (lunocenter). The ILRF realization is\nbased on variance component estimation of the three lunar ephemeris solutions:\nINPOP21a, DE430, and EPM2021 for the series of the position of the lunar center\nof mass and rotation Euler angles -- precession, nutation, and proper rotation.\nThe solution is valid starting with the period covered by Lunar Laser Ranging\n(LLR) data in 1970 and ending with extrapolated ILRF realizations in 2052 for\nfuture lunar missions. Results. The combined ILRF is characterized by the mean\nerror of 17.6 cm for 2010-2030, where 15.3 cm comes from the origin and 8.6 cm\nfrom the orientation realization. The error in the realization of the origin is\nmainly caused by a poor geometry of the retroreflector network, resulting in a\nhigh correlation between the scale and the X component of the lunocenter in PA.\nThe LLR post-fit residuals in ILRF are at the level of 2-3 cm in terms of the\nstandard deviations of one-way ranges for best-performing LLR stations. The\nmean errors of the transformation between ILRF and other reference frame\nrealizations in PA are at the level of 3 cm, whereas the mean transformation\nerror to the DE421 Mean Earth frame equals 5 cm."}

Volcanism could potentially play a role in\nclimatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth.\nObservation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus\nspacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian\ncharacteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and\ncomposition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume\npropagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an\nidealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME\nvolcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian\nconditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The\npresent study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of\naltitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H\ntropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For\nthe first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds\nhave a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes.\nContrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on\ntemperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to\npropagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due\nto the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher\naltitudes."}

Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly\nduring the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet\nformation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is\nparticularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of\nmolecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods.\nIn this work, we present high-resolution ($\\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3\nmillimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected\nlarge, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and\nHCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing\ncentral, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics\nand spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of\nspatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\\sim$8 au\nin radius, to extended $\\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find\nthat CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk,\npossibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21),\nSO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more\nextended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk,\naccretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions.\nMost COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar,\nwhile other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or\noutflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams\nsuggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously,\nmaking it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these\nfindings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system.\nAbridged."}

We applied reference differential\nimaging to extract the disk intensity for the $V$ and $Ks$ bands using star\nhopping observations. We obtained the first $V$-band total intensity for HD\n100453 with ZIMPOL star hopping. The integrated total flux $I_{\\rm\ndisk}/I_{\\star}(V)=1.5\\%$ increases to $I_{\\rm disk}/I_{\\star}(K)=4.8\\%$.

We then used RADMC-3D radiative transfer modeling with a parametrized\nHenyey-Greenstein phase function to constrain the dust properties. From the $V$\nto $Ks$ band, the dominating dust in the outer disk has an increasing\nscattering albedo and degree of polarization, while the asymmetry parameter\nslightly decreases.
