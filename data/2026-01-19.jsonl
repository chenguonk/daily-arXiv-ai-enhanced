Owen"], "title": "The impact of disc photoevaporation on the long-term evolution of giant planets in mean motion resonances", "comment": "Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia."}

For the jet morphology, we measure the PA at multiple epochs by applying the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter to Hubble Space Telescope images between November 20, 2025 and December 27, 2025, and model the phase-folded PA curve with weighted least-squares Fourier series up to two harmonics while scanning trial periods P to identify minima in \\c{hi}2(P). For the photometry, we adopt the best-fit period from an independent 30-minute binned analysis (from a 0.25 meter telescope MPC L92) based on a refined \\c{hi}2(P) profile for a sinusoidal model with nightly offsets. We find that the jet-PA modulation gives a period Pjet = 7.20 +/-0.05 h (adopting a conservative uncertainty dominated by sparse sampling and systematics), while the photometry yields Pphot = 7.136+/-0.001 h (formal 1σ uncertainty). Although the periods differ slightly, the offset is plausibly attributable to non-Gaussian systematics and aliasing. The combined data supports a post-perihelion rotation period of 7.1 h associated with precession of the jet structure around the rotation axis by 20°. The rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within 20°"}

Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population.\n  In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of $10418_{-1400}^{+2400}$ d and a mass of $3.71_{-0.43}^{+0.68} M_{\\text{Jup}}$, while HD 114386 c orbits at $444.00_{-0.88}^{+0.93}$ d with a minimum mass of $0.37 \\pm 0.03 M_{\\text{Jup}}$.\n  The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia.\n  This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research."}

Here we present Doppler tomography of three known hot Jupiters to determine their λ orientation: HAT-P-49 b, HAT-P-57A b, and XO-3A b. Our analysis explores the impact of cross-correlation processing methods on the detectability and characterization of the planet's Doppler shadow using up to three independent routines for cross-correlation functions extraction; those being: Yabi, iSpec and IRAF. After accounting for differences among the results obtained with the various routines, we report: first, the HAT-P-49 system is a case of a hot Jupiter on a polar orbit with λ=-85.3{\\pm}1.7°, second, HAT-P-57A indicates practically no deviation of the planet's projected orbit from the host's equatorial plane with λ=-0.4^{+1.4}_{-1.9}°, and third, the XO-3A system with the measured value of λ=38{+3}_{-4}° lies in between an aligned and a perpendicular orientation, which is a less populated region of the spin-orbit distribution. Our findings highlight both the diversity of spin-orbit angles among close-in giant planets and the potential discrepancies in their measurement that can arise from different approaches to constructing the cross-correlation functions."}

Effects of diffraction, interferences, and stellar diameter", "comment": "20 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "Central flashes occur during stellar occultations by solar system objects. We catalog diffraction effects on the flash with point-like stars, monochromatic waves and spherical transparent atmosphere. Diffraction involves the Huygens principle, the Sommerfeld lemma and the stationary phase method, while finite stellar diameter cases involve Clausius' theorem. For point-like stars, the central flash shape is that of the classical Poisson spot, but with larger height. For tenuous atmospheres that cannot focus the stellar rays at shadow center, the flash is amplified by the factor (R_0/r_0)^2 compared to the Poisson spot, where R0 and r0 are the object and the shadow radii, respectively. For denser atmospheres that can focus the rays at shadow center, the flash peaks at 2[(pi*R/lambda_F})^2]*phi0, where R is the central flash layer radius, lambda_F is the Fresnel scale and phi0 is the flux that would be observed at shadow center without focusing. For isothermal atmospheres with scale height H, the height is 2(R*H)(pi/lambda_F)^2. Fringes surrounding the central flash are separated by lambda_P=lambda_F^2/R, related to the separation between the primary and secondary stellar images. For a projected stellar diameter D*>lambda_P, the flash is described by complete elliptic integrals, and has full width at half maximum of 1.14D* and peak value 8H/D*. For Earth-based occultations by Pluto and Triton observed in the visible with point-like stars, diffraction causes flashes with very large heights ~10e4-10e5, spread over a very small meter-sized region in the shadow plane. In practice, the flash is usually smoothed by the stellar diameter, but still reaches high values of ~50 and ~200 during Pluto and Triton occultations, respectively. Diffraction dominates when using millimeter wavelengths or longer. Effects of departure from sphericity, atmospheric waves and stellar limb darkening are discussed."}

The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS's minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star ($I=22$) is measured from the DREAMS's $r - z$ color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}$. A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of $\\sim 0.3\\,M_\\odot$, a planetary mass of $\\sim 40\\,M_{\\oplus}$, a projected planet-host separation of $\\sim 1.6~\\mathrm{au}$, and a lens distance of $\\sim 7.5~\\mathrm{kpc}$. Based on the photometric precision achieved by DREAMS for this event, we simulate free-floating planet (FFP) detections and find that DREAMS is sensitive to Mars-mass FFPs in the Galactic bulge and Moon-mass FFPs in the Galactic disk."}
