Contradictory answers appear in the\nliterature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a\nsharply truncated edge: the surface density $\\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge,\nand the $\\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it\nvanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out\nof the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An\nedge where $\\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed\nfor astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by\nHunter & Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in\nthree ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by\nsolving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion\nrelation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show\nthat softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat\ndisk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's\nLaplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more\naccurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of\nmagnitude."}

Here we present laboratory results from HANKA\n(High-resolution mass Analyzer for Nano-scale Kinetic Astro materials), a\ncompact Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer developed towards the goal of a\nuniversal dust detector for space applications. Using infrared laser ablation\nand plasma formation under vacuum, we analyzed solid-state samples\nrepresentative of Lunar, Martian, and Meteoritic material. The resulting mass\nspectra - recorded at resolving powers of R=60000 - reveal complex, but\ncharacteristic element mixtures. These results demonstrate the single event\nsensitivity of HANKA, and its mass resolution with the ability to resolve\ncomplex mass spectra and possibly differentiate geochemical signatures across\nplanetary bodies. The dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude enables even the\ndetection of trace compounds. The minimalistic impact sampling approach enables\nfast, high-precision compositional mass analysis without complex sample\npreparation, making the instrument well-suited for orbital, surface, or flyby\nmissions with expected dust impacts. Our system consists of an IR-laser system\nthat simulates impacts of nano to micron sized solid-state dust and ice\nparticles from space. It therefore allows to perform so called analogue\nexperiments in the laboratory. We conclude that IR- laser pulses on a\nsolid-state material are not only well suited for ice particle impact analogues\nbut also a good analogue experiment for solid state particle impacts on a dust\ndetector electrode in space. Moreover, the IR laser is employed only for an\noptimal analogue experiment simulating the impact event - it is not necessary\nin space on a spacecraft detecting space dust."}

This instability creates ideal intersections for\nlow-energy pathways that spacecraft can traverse and serves as an important\ntest case for stability at Lagrange points for high $\\mu$ binaries. This study\nmodels the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body\nProblem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless\nparticle with known low-$\\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories\nfor instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the\ncorresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the\nposition and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed\nchaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial\nparameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the\ninfluence of higher values of $\\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These\nfindings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and\ninstead behaves as a system of chaotic transport.

While most hot Jupiters are\nbelieved to form via tidal migration, the presence of adjacent companions is\nnot easily explained by this formation mechanism, requiring consideration of\nadditional formation mechanisms such as disk migration and in situ formation.\nIn this work, we explore the possibility of in situ formation for both hot\nJupiters and their interior companions. Using numerical simulations performed\nwith the N-body integrator REBOUND, we investigate the growth of interior\ncompanions under various assumptions about disk conditions and hot Jupiter\nfinal orbital positions. Our results show that if a sufficiently high density\nof planetary embryos is transported to short orbital radii, it is feasible for\nboth hot Jupiters and their interior companions to form in situ, providing a\nviable explanation for a subset of observed planetary architectures."}
