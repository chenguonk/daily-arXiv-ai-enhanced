In systems with more than one\nplanet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via\nplanet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken\ninto account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars\nin young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect\nyoung multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the\nabsence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet\nsystem do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with\nanother star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these\nexternal perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by\na situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of\nencounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a\n\"preferred\" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was\nperturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the\nreaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation\nin our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5,\n5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner\nplanets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The\nreduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr."}

Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we\nmodel broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km.\nThe presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower\nthermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals\nand prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids\nfragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond\n150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak,\nlong-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation\nand diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that\nFS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival \"N-waves,\" broadening\npotential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other\natmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS\nstructure impacts shock wave propagation.

Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their\nvertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation\nprocesses. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$\ngas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS\nJ04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical\ntemperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA\narchival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm\ntogether with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust\ndisk properties using the tomographic method and the \\textsc{DiskFit} model.\nResults. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the\nH$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission\ncharacterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane\ntemperatures of $\\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived\nfrom $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being\nthermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\\sim 3\n\\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The\natmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\\sim$ 31 K at a radius of\n100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the\ndust outer radius ($\\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a\nradius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.\nConclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first\nquantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct\nobservation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the\ntemperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K\nin the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\\sim$ 35 K above."}

We present new JWST NIRSpec\nG395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in\nunprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the\nhigh-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal\nemission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon\nmonoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all\norbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2,\nindicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also\nmoderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide\n(SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical\nproduction under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O ~ 1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X\nSolar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature\natmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing\natmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere\ndespite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where\nfew planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot\nNeptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate. This makes LTT-9779 b a\nvaluable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes\nunder extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in\nthe hot Neptune desert."}

However, a clear\ncorrelation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry\nremains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets\naround M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical\ninformation. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$\n$\\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances.\nWe use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying\ndata-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22\nrocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse\nrelationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation\nbecomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we\nassume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests\nthat low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus\nhigher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend,\nillustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of\nhost star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic\nchemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like\nplanet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the\nGalaxy."}
