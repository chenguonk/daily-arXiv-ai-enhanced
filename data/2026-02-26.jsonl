In this work, we extend the so-called \"breaking-the-chains\" model to account for both of these characteristics. Assuming that super-Earths are settled into stable chains of resonances after disk-driven migration, we show that scattering a planetesimal population that contains only a few percent of a system's mass can reorganize primordial chains in remarkable ways. The planetesimal scattering \"rattles\" the chains by repelling adjacent planet pairs wide of their initial MMRs. Some chains remain rattled but otherwise intact and make up the observed excesses wide of MMRs. In other systems, however, this initial rattling sows the seeds of later orbital instabilities that break the chains entirely. If individual planetesimals' masses are of order a Pluto mass or so, the onset of these instabilities can occur tens or hundreds of Myr after birth, naturally explaining the apparent disappearance of near-resonant pairs on this timescale. The origin of such Pluto-mass debris is currently unknown."}

Stevenson"], "title": "Formation of Water-rich Giant Planet Satellites at Decretion Disk Ice Lines", "comment": null, "summary": "The volatile budgets of giant planet satellites are critical to unraveling the origin of their building blocks within the circumplanetary disks that hosted them. The Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as the Saturnian moon Titan, are known to be anomalously water rich on the basis of their mean densities and interior models informed by gravity data from Galileo and Cassini, characterized by ice-to-rock ratios around unity. Here, we show that the water-ice sublimation line in a decreting circumplanetary disk lends itself to the formation of a water-rich solid reservoir, serving as a natural site for the birthplace of icy satellites. Fundamentally, this reflects how interior to the ice line, water vapor is advected outward, while beyond it, water ice drifts inward as pebbles. Using a semi-analytic model for dust and vapor evolution, we simulate vapor and ice accumulation at the ice line, showing that solids just beyond it achieve steady-state ice-to-rock ratios a factor of a few higher than elsewhere in the disk. For typical disk parameters, this ice buildup occurs within a timescale of a few thousand years. We propose this as a first-order process that explains, at least to some extent, the compositions of three aforementioned satellites. We explore the impact of uncertain turbulence parameters on our results, namely the turbulent Schmidt number and Shakura-Sunyaev alpha, before discussing them in the context of icy satellite D/H ratios. We conclude by evaluating alternative scenarios for explaining water-rich satellites, based on the conversion of CO to CH4, with water as a by-product."}

In this paper, we present moving object time-series photometry with this facility, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. 3I/ATLAS was first robustly recovered by HATPI on the night of 2025 July 2 (one night after its discovery) at a Gaia $G$-band magnitude of $G = 17.796 \\pm 0.082$ mag ($\\pm 0.030$ mag systematic uncertainty). The comet then increased in brightness to $G = 14.071 \\pm 0.073$ mag $\\pm 0.030$ mag by 2025 Sep 13, after which it became unobservable by HATPI as it approached perihelion. Before 3I/ATLAS achieved a brightness of $G = 16.396 \\pm 0.029$ mag $\\pm 0.030$ mag on 2025 Aug 6, it could be detected when stacking all HATPI observations from a single night, while after this date it is sufficiently bright to detect in individual 45 s exposures. We do not detect evidence for significant short-time-scale variations in the brightness of 3I/ATLAS after Aug 6. Compared to other light curves in the literature, the HATPI photometry exhibits a somewhat steeper rise in brightness with decreasing heliocentric distance, $r_{H}$. The HATPI magnitudes are well-fit as a power law function of $r_{H}$, with an exponential index of $n = 5.167 \\pm 0.095$, over the range $2.14$ AU $ < r_{H} < 4.44$ AU, compared to $n = 3.94 \\pm 0.10$ when fitting together with other literature observations. We find that the phase function is constrained to $β= 0.0552 \\pm 0.0032$ mag deg$^{-1}$."}

For published version and associated movie, see https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202557988", "summary": "Many small satellites in the Solar System have sub-synchronous orbits, meaning their orbits are decaying due to tidal dissipation. Unless they have substantial material strength, they will eventually tidally disrupt before reaching their planet's surface. We studied the fate of rubble-pile satellites as they migrate inward, with a particular focus on the case of Phobos. We used a combination of analytic estimates and numerical simulations to determine the failure mode and tidal disruption distance of a Phobos-like satellite, as a function of its shape and cohesive strength. Both analytically and numerically, we identify a regime for satellites with low cohesive strengths whereby their surface can be tidally stripped without undergoing internal failure. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that Phobos will be destroyed beyond 2 Mars radii if it has a bulk strength similar to those estimated for small bodies recently visited by spacecraft. Based on our results and some additional arguments, we suggest that previous studies on the fate of Phobos have overestimated its strength, and therefore underestimated its tidal disruption distance. We also speculate that if Phobos undergoes some tidal stripping, its ultimate fate may be determined by runaway collisional erosion rather than a pure tidal disruption. However, the ultimate tidal disruption distance for Phobos will depend on its unknown internal structure and bulk material properties, which will be constrained by JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission and its IDEFIX rover. These results have implications for theories about the origin and evolution of the Martian moons and for tidal disruptions of other small, irregularly shaped satellites."}

We find that models combining viscous evolution with external photoevaporation yield disk lifetimes of $3\\text{-}7\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$, consistent with observed dispersal timescales, particularly for $10^{-4} \\leq α\\leq 10^{-2}$. Low-mass stars ($0.1\\,$M$_\\odot$) are more susceptible to disk dispersal due to their weaker gravitational binding, with their fraction among all surviving disks dropping from $76\\%$ at birth to $51\\%$ by $10\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. The majority of the long-lived disks are those with low viscosity $α< 10^{-3.5}$ and initial characteristic radius $R_c < 125\\,\\mathrm{AU}$, while the initial disk-to-star mass ratio does not play an important role. The median gas disk mass and radius of the surviving disks exhibit a sharp decline in the first $0.2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, followed by a slight increase that reflects survivorship bias. We also explore correlations between gas disk mass and size vs. stellar mass and FUV strength. Our findings highlight the critical role of external photoevaporation in shaping disk populations even at moderate levels of FUV radiation fields."}

Chapter written for the the workshop 'Exocomets: Bridging our Understanding of Minor Bodies in Solar and Exoplanetary Systems' (July 2024), at the International Space Science Insitute (ISSI), Bern", "summary": "Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures.\n  This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $β$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $β$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars."}
