### [1] [Causal evidence for the primordiality of colours in trans-Neptunian objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10089)
*Benjamin L. Davis,Mohamad Ali-Dib,Yujia Zheng,Zehao Jin,Kun Zhang,Andrea Valerio Macciò*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文通过数据驱动方法分析TNOs颜色与轨道特性的因果关系，发现颜色反映其形成位置而非后续演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TNOs颜色起源问题，以理解太阳系历史。

Method: 采用模型无关的数据驱动方法，分析两个数据集，使用两种条件独立性测试方法。

Result: 模型预测TNOs颜色是其轨道分布的根源，且需一个未知混杂变量（与海王星效应一致）。

Conclusion: TNOs颜色主要为原始形成特征，而非后续演化结果。

Abstract: The origins of the colours of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a
crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar
System. Recent observational surveys revealed correlations between the
eccentricity and inclination of TNOs, and their colours. This rekindled the
long-standing debate on whether these colours reflect the conditions of TNO
formation or their subsequent evolution. We address this question using a
model-agnostic, data-driven approach that unanimously converges to a common
causal graph from the analysis of two different datasets, each from two
different conditional independence test methods. For evaluation, we demonstrate
how our model is consistent with the currently-accepted paradigms of TNOs'
dynamical histories, without involving any orbital modelling or physics-based
assumptions. Our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)
predicts the need for an unknown confounding variable, consistent with
Neptune's effects. The model predicts that the colour of TNOs is the root cause
of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way around. This
strongly suggests that the colours of TNOs reflect an underlying dynamical
property, most likely their formation location. Our model excludes formation
scenarios that invoke substantial colour modification by subsequent evolution.
We conclude that the colours of TNOs are predominantly primordial.

### [2] [Strong NUV Refractory Absorption and Dissociated Water in the Hubble Transmission Spectrum of the Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10092)
*Yayaati Chachan,Joshua Lothringer,Julie Inglis,Hayley Beltz,Heather A. Knutson,Jessica Spake,Bjorn Benneke,Ian Wong,Zafar Rustamkulov,David Sing,Katherine A. Bennett*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文研究了超热木星KELT-20 b的大气成分，通过哈勃太空望远镜观测其0.2-1.7微米的透射光谱，发现近紫外波段有显著上升，可能与Fe II或SiO有关，而近红外的水吸收特征较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超热木星的大气成分可以揭示其形成历史和组成，KELT-20 b的轨道与宿主恒星自转轴对齐，研究其独特动力学配置是否反映在成分中。

Method: 使用哈勃太空望远镜观测KELT-20 b的透射光谱，并进行化学平衡假设下的成分反演。

Result: 近紫外波段深度显著增加，可能与Fe II或SiO相关；水分子在近红外波段吸收较弱；未检测到明显的肢体不对称性。

Conclusion: KELT-20 b的大气成分与其他超热木星相似，未因动力学配置不同而显著差异，冷凝和沉降仅限于最耐高温的物种。

Abstract: Ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) present a promising pathway for drawing a link
between a planet's composition and formation history. They retain both
refractory and volatiles species in gas phase in their atmospheres, which
allows us to place unique constraints on their building blocks. Here, we
present the 0.2 - 1.7 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Unlike other UHJs around
early-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin
axis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in
its composition. We observe a tremendous rise (>10 scale heights) in the
planet's transit depth at the near-UV wavelengths, akin to that observed for
WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b, and a muted water absorption feature in the near-IR.
Our retrievals indicate that the large NUV depth is driven by Fe II and/or SiO
and that the water is mostly thermally dissociated. Assuming equilibrium
chemistry, we obtain constraints on Z/H and O/H that indicate accretion of
volatile-rich solids and/or gas. Both our low resolution spectrum and the
refractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside
condensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the
planet's atmosphere. Within the precision limits of the HST spectra, no strong
evidence for limb asymmetry is detected. We contextualize this lack of
asymmetry by comparing to predictions from general circulation models with and
without the effects of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Lastly, we find no major
differences in the HST transmission spectra of KELT-20 b, WASP-178, and
WASP-121 b despite their different dynamical configurations.

### [3] [A constraint on the density of Jupiter's moon Thebe from primordial dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10109)
*Ian R. Brunton,Konstantin Batygin*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文预测了木星第六大卫星Thebe的平均密度和质量下限，并探讨了其在木星内部卫星起源模型中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前仅对木星系统中的六个卫星的质量和密度进行了测定，Thebe的密度和质量对理解木星内部卫星的起源和动力学演化至关重要。

Method: 通过模拟Amalthea和Thebe在木星盘时期的共振引力迁移，结合气动阻力导致的共振动力学不稳定性，推导Thebe的密度下限。

Result: 预测Thebe的平均密度下限为1.0 g/cm³（质量下限为5×10²⁰ g），其较小的半径需要更高的密度以确保其轨道距离超过Amalthea。

Conclusion: Thebe的质量测量将有助于验证或否定木星内部卫星动力学演化的理论模型，未来太空任务提供了实证机会。

Abstract: Of the 97 known satellites in the Jovian system, the individual masses and
densities of each moon have only been determined for six of them: the four
Galileans, Amalthea, and Himalia. In this letter, we derive a prediction for
the mean density (and mass) of Thebe, Jupiter's sixth largest regular moon,
obtaining a lower limit of $\rho_\text{T}\gtrsim1.0$ g/cm$^3$
($m_\text{T}\gtrsim 5\times 10^{20}$ g). In particular, this value emerges as a
key constraint within the context of the resonant transport model for the
origins of Jupiter's interior satellites. Expanding on this theory, here we
carry out simulations of the simultaneous gravitational shepherding of Amalthea
and Thebe via the resonant influence of inward-migrating Io during Jupiter's
disk-bearing epoch. We find that owing to overstability of resonant dynamics
facilitated by the circumjovian disk's aerodynamic drag, Thebe's smaller radius
(compared to that of Amalthea's) requires a higher density to ensure its
terminal orbital distance exceeds that of Amalthea's, as it does today. With
multiple current and upcoming space missions devoted to in situ exploration of
the Jovian system, a proper measurement of Thebe's mass provides an avenue
towards empirical falsification or confirmation of our theoretical model for
the dynamical evolution of Jupiter's inner moons.

### [4] [The Perturbation Theory Approach to Stability in the Scattered Disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10119)
*Matthew Belyakov,Konstantin Batygin*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Batygin等人的模型，通过更高阶的球谐展开研究海王星引力对散射盘天体混沌行为的影响，发现高阶共振链的交叠是混沌行为的主要驱动力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究散射盘天体（SDOs）的混沌动力学，尤其是海王星引力扰动对其轨道稳定性的影响。

Method: 采用球谐展开至八极及以上阶数，分析高阶共振链（如2:j、3:j等）的交叠对混沌行为的贡献。

Result: 高阶共振链的交叠是混沌行为的主要驱动力，而非单一共振链主导。

Conclusion: 散射盘天体的混沌行为由多阶共振链的交叠共同决定，这解释了其动力学分布特征。

Abstract: Scattered disk objects (SDOs) are distant minor bodies that orbit the sun on
highly eccentric orbits, frequently with perhelia near Neptune's orbit.
Gravitational perturbations due to Neptune frequently lead to chaotic dynamics,
with the degree of chaotic diffusion set by an object's perihelion distance.
Batygin et al. (2021) developed a perturbative approach for scattered disk
dynamics, finding that, to leading order in semi-major axis ratio, an infinite
series of $2:j$ resonances drives the dynamics of the distant scattered disk,
with overlaps between resonances driving chaotic motion. In this work we extend
this model by taking the spherical harmonic expansion for Neptune's
gravitational potential to octupole order and beyond. In continuing the
expansion out to smaller semi-major axis limits, we find that the $1:j$ and
$3:j$ resonances that emerge in the octupole expansion do not individually set
new limits on the stability boundary. Instead, we find that for increasingly
Neptune-proximate orbits, resonances of progressively higher index are dominant
in explaining the emergence of chaotic behavior. In this picture, the mutual
intersections between series of $2:j$, $3:j$, $4:j \dots,$ resonant chains
explain local chaotic evolution of SDOs and shape the dynamical distribution of
the population at large.

### [5] [PLATOSpec's first results: planets WASP-35b and TOI-622b are on aligned orbits, and K2-237b is on a polar orbit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10145)
*J. Zak,P. Kabath,H. M. J. Boffin,J. Liptak,M. Skarka,R. Brahm,P. Gajdoš,A. Bocchieri,D. Itrich,L. Vanzi,P. Pintr,J. Janik,A. Hatzes*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文通过PLATOSpec仪器测量了三颗气态系外行星的自旋轨道角，揭示了不同的迁移路径，并强调了与大气测量结合的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自旋轨道角分布机制，以理解行星迁移路径，并展示地面与空间观测的协同作用。

Method: 使用PLATOSpec仪器测量Rossiter-McLaughlin效应，确定三颗行星的自旋轨道角（λ和ψ）。

Result: WASP-35b与文献数据一致；TOI-622b轨道对齐，支持盘迁移；K2-237b极轨道，支持无盘迁移。

Conclusion: 这些结果为行星形成和演化提供了新见解，未来大气特征研究将进一步完善理解。

Abstract: The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital
axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms
shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood.
Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a
powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between
ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous
exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152
Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda =
1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent
agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit
measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle
$\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with
quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and
$\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit,
which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting
previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely
populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting
stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens
tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are
compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these
dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their
formation and evolution.

### [6] [Replicating the flyby sampling of salty ocean world ice grains using impact ionization mass spectrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10169)

Motivation: 由于化学成分和撞击速度的混淆效应，以及模拟条件下加速冰粒的困难，从太空撞击质谱中获取定量成分信息具有挑战性。

Method: 采用新型超高速冰粒加速和撞击质谱法，量化NaCl富集冰粒的质谱受化学成分和撞击速度变化的影响。

Result: 研究表明，高保真度研究量化质谱中的成分和速度相关效应，可能对准确解释欧罗巴及其他海洋世界的数据至关重要。

Conclusion: 未来任务中，需进一步研究以准确解释撞击质谱数据，尤其是化学成分和速度的影响。

Abstract: The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and
analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact
mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical
composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional
information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically
proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact
velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft
velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice
grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree
to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical
composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges
planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that
high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in
impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at
Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.

### [7] [Thermospheric Density, Composition, and Temperature from GOES-R/SUVI Solar Occultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10242)
*Robert H. A. Sewell,Edward M. B. Thiemann,Jocelyn Lafyatis,Kevin Hallock,Christopher Bethge,Marcin Pilinski,Eric K. Sutton,Courtney L. Peck,Daniel B. Seaton*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种基于SUVI太阳掩星测量的新数据集，用于测量热层中的原子氧和分子氮密度及温度剖面，并评估了其不确定性和模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种新方法，利用EUV太阳掩星图像测量热层状态，填补当前热层温度和密度测量的空白。

Method: 使用SUVI的17.1、19.5和30.4 nm通道进行太阳掩星测量，推导出密度和温度剖面，并评估不确定性和模型偏差。

Result: 在250 km高度，O和N2的密度随机不确定度分别为8%和17%，温度不确定度为3%。与MSIS模型的比较显示，在安静太阳条件下密度差异显著。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于实时空间天气监测和预测，填补了热层测量的空白，并支持模型改进。

Abstract: A new dataset of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen number density
profiles, along with thermospheric temperature profiles between 180 and 500 km,
has been developed. These profiles are derived from solar occultation
measurements made by SUVI on the GOES-R satellites, using the 17.1, 19.5, and
30.4 nm channels. Discussed is the novel approach and methods for using EUV
solar occultation images to measuring the thermospheric state. Measurement
uncertainties are presented as a function of tangent altitude. At 250 km,
number density random uncertainties are found to be 8% and 17% for O and N2,
respectively, and the random uncertainty for neutral temperature at 250 km was
found to be 3%. The impact of effective cross section uncertainty on retrieval
bias was assessed, revealing that, as expected, the largest effects occur where
O and N2 are minor absorbers. In contrast, total mass density and O/N2 ratios
exhibit substantially lower sensitivity, with biases that remain small or
nearly constant with altitude. Total mass density comparisons with the MSIS
model show good agreement at the dusk terminator, with an average difference of
-2%, but larger discrepancies at dawn, with an average difference of -26%.
These discrepancies are more prominent during quiet solar conditions,
suggesting an overestimation of densities by MSIS during these conditions.
Density comparisons with the IDEA and Dragster assimilative models show
dawn/dusk percent differences of -24%/-2% and +2%/+13%, respectively. The
dataset is available through the NOAA GOES-R L2 pipeline for eclipse seasons
from Sept. 2018 onward and is expected to continue through 2035. As this
measurement relies only on real-time NOAA space weather SUVI images, these
profiles could be produced in real-time, supporting critical space weather
monitoring and prediction, and filling in a current measurement gap of
thermospheric temperature and density.

Conclusion: 冰粒子通量与盘结构密切相关，系统间差异可能影响行星系统架构和水分布。

Abstract: The influx of icy pebbles to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks
constitutes a fundamental ingredient in most planet formation theories. The
observational determination of the magnitude of this pebble flux and its
dependence on disk substructure (disk gaps as pebble traps) would be a
significant step forward. In this work we analyze a sample of 21 T Tauri disks
(with ages $\approx 0.5{-}2\mathrm{~Myr}$) using JWST/MIRI spectra
homogeneously reduced with the JDISCS pipeline and high-angular-resolution ALMA
continuum data. We find that the 1500/6000 K water line flux ratio measured
with JWST - a tracer of cold water vapor and pebble drift near the snowline -
correlates with the radial location of the innermost dust gap in ALMA continuum
observations (ranging from 8.7 to 69 au), confirming predictions from recent
models that study connections between the inner and outer disk reservoirs. We
develop a population synthesis exploration of pebble drift in gapped disks and
find a good match to the observed trend for early and relatively effective
gaps, while scenarios where pebble drift happens quickly, gaps are very leaky,
or where gaps form late are disfavored on a population level. Inferred snowline
pebble mass fluxes (ranging between $10^{-6}$ and
$10^{-3}~M_\oplus/\mathrm{yr}$ depending on gap position) are comparable to
fluxes used in pebble accretion studies and those proposed for the inner Solar
System, while system-to-system variations suggest differences in the emerging
planetary system architectures and water budgets.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究结合JWST的两种观测模式（G395H和G395M）对GJ 1132 b的大气层进行约束，发现其传输光谱最适合平坦线，表明可能没有大气层或仅有极薄的大气层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GJ 1132 b是一颗典型的M矮星岩石系外行星，因其亮度和轨道特性成为研究目标。通过结合不同观测模式，旨在更准确地评估其大气层存在与否。

Method: 结合JWST的NIRSpec/G395H和G395M两种模式的传输光谱数据，并采用“留一传输法”建模，同时考虑恒星异质性变化。

Result: 传输光谱数据最适合平坦线，表明GJ 1132 b可能没有大气层或仅有极薄的大气层。结合MIRI/LRS发射数据，进一步支持这一结论。

Conclusion: GJ 1132 b很可能是一颗裸露的岩石行星，其年龄和距离表明其大气层不稳定。研究强调了在多访传输中考虑恒星异质性的重要性。

Abstract: As an archetypal M-dwarf rocky exoplanet, GJ 1132 b has a varied history of
atmospheric measurements. At 1.13 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, 1.66 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, and
580 K, it orbits a bright, slowly rotating M dwarf in a 1.6-day period, making
it a prime target for characterization. In this study, we combine two JWST
NIRSpec/G395H transits previously reported by May and MacDonald et al. 2023
with two new NIRSpec/G395M transits to constrain the presence of an atmosphere.
This marks the first time the G395H and G395M modes have been combined for a
single target, and we report no difference in the quality of data between the
two modes. For rocky M-dwarf studies, G395H may still be preferred if stacking
transits to utilize the high-resolution flux-calibrated stellar spectra and
assess evolving stellar heterogeneity. GJ 1132 b's co-added transmission
spectrum is best-fit with a flat line. A thin steam atmosphere is also
consistent with the data, but this interpretation is driven almost entirely by
the first transit, which suggests an increase in cool spot coverage-fraction
derived from the flux-calibrated stellar spectra. This demonstrates the
importance of always considering stellar heterogeneity evolution in multi-visit
transits, and also the importance of a "leave-one-transit-out" approach in
modeling efforts of co-added transits. We combine these results with MIRI/LRS
emission data (Xue et al. 2024) to show that together, transmission and
emission are consistent with only the thinnest of atmospheres. Given GJ 1132
b's age and distance from the star, a thin atmosphere is not likely stable.
Therefore, the simplest explanation is that GJ 1132 b is indeed a bare rock.

TL;DR: 研究了在死区内边界（DZIB）处通过卵石吸积形成近地行星的条件，发现当吸积率降至约10^-9 M⊙/yr时，卵石捕获效率最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Inside-Out Planet Formation（IOPF）理论中卵石在DZIB处捕获的条件，为近地行星的形成提供边界条件。

Method: 通过分析吸积率和卵石大小对卵石捕获效率的影响，确定DZIB位置和卵石捕获的最佳条件。

Result: 当吸积率降至约10^-9 M⊙/yr且DZIB位于0.1 au时，典型卵石大小约0.5 mm时捕获效率最高。

Conclusion: 研究为IOPF理论提供了重要边界条件，并可能解释原行星盘中过渡盘相的出现。

Abstract: Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory of {\it in situ} formation via
pebble accretion of close-in Earth to Super-Earth mass planets at the pressure
maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB), whose location is
set initially by thermal ionization of alkali metals at $\sim1,200\:$K. With
midplane disk temperatures determined by viscous accretional heating, the
radial location of the DZIB depends on the accretion rate of the disk. Here, we
investigate the ability of pebbles to be trapped at the DZIB as a function of
the accretion rate and pebble size. We discuss the conditions that are needed
for pebble trapping to become efficient when the accretion rate drops to
$\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and the resulting DZIB is at $\sim
0.1\:$au, which is the expected evolutionary phase of the disk at the onset of
IOPF. This provides an important boundary condition for IOPF theory, i.e., the
properties of pebbles when planet formation begins. We find for our fiducial
model that typical pebble sizes of $\sim0.5\:$mm are needed for pebble trapping
to first become efficient at DZIBs near 0.1~au. This model may also provide an
explanation for the first emergence of the transition disk phase in
protoplanetary disks with accretion rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm
yr}^{-1}$.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习（ML）算法是否可用于预测任意潮汐锁定气态系外行星的3D温度和风结构，以解决传统3D气候模型计算耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着望远镜技术的进步，观测系外行星大气的能力增强，但传统3D气候模型（GCMs）计算耗时，限制了模拟范围。本研究旨在利用ML算法快速预测行星大气结构。

Method: 研究引入了一个包含60颗膨胀热木星的3D GCM网格，并使用密集神经网络（DNN）和决策树算法（XGBoost）训练模型，预测局部气体温度及风场。

Result: ML模型预测的气体温度精度高，计算光谱差异小（32 ppm以内），且能可靠预测潮汐锁定木星的3D温度场。

Conclusion: ML模拟器为系外行星研究提供了快速工具，可扩展传统GCM网格，且预测质量对气体化学和光谱影响极小。

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.
