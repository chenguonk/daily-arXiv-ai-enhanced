### [1] [Causal evidence for the primordiality of colours in trans-Neptunian objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10089)
*Benjamin L. Davis,Mohamad Ali-Dib,Yujia Zheng,Zehao Jin,Kun Zhang,Andrea Valerio Macciò*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文通过数据驱动的方法分析TNOs颜色与轨道参数的关系，发现颜色是其轨道分布的根源，表明颜色主要反映原始形成位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TNOs颜色起源问题，以理解太阳系历史。

Method: 采用模型无关的数据驱动方法，分析两组数据集，使用两种条件独立性检验方法。

Result: 模型预测TNOs颜色是其轨道分布的根源，且需要未知混杂变量（与海王星效应一致），排除了后续演化对颜色的显著影响。

Conclusion: TNOs颜色主要为原始形成特征，反映其形成位置。

Abstract: The origins of the colours of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a
crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar
System. Recent observational surveys revealed correlations between the
eccentricity and inclination of TNOs, and their colours. This rekindled the
long-standing debate on whether these colours reflect the conditions of TNO
formation or their subsequent evolution. We address this question using a
model-agnostic, data-driven approach that unanimously converges to a common
causal graph from the analysis of two different datasets, each from two
different conditional independence test methods. For evaluation, we demonstrate
how our model is consistent with the currently-accepted paradigms of TNOs'
dynamical histories, without involving any orbital modelling or physics-based
assumptions. Our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)
predicts the need for an unknown confounding variable, consistent with
Neptune's effects. The model predicts that the colour of TNOs is the root cause
of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way around. This
strongly suggests that the colours of TNOs reflect an underlying dynamical
property, most likely their formation location. Our model excludes formation
scenarios that invoke substantial colour modification by subsequent evolution.
We conclude that the colours of TNOs are predominantly primordial.

### [2] [Strong NUV Refractory Absorption and Dissociated Water in the Hubble Transmission Spectrum of the Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10092)
*Yayaati Chachan,Joshua Lothringer,Julie Inglis,Hayley Beltz,Heather A. Knutson,Jessica Spake,Bjorn Benneke,Ian Wong,Zafar Rustamkulov,David Sing,Katherine A. Bennett*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文研究了超热木星KELT-20 b的大气成分，通过哈勃望远镜观测其0.2-1.7微米的透射光谱，发现近紫外波段有显著上升，可能与Fe II或SiO有关，而近红外水吸收特征较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超热木星的大气成分与其形成历史之间的联系，特别是KELT-20 b的独特动力学配置是否反映在其化学成分中。

Method: 使用哈勃望远镜观测KELT-20 b的透射光谱，并通过化学平衡假设分析其元素丰度。

Result: 发现近紫外波段深度显著上升，可能与Fe II或SiO相关；水吸收特征较弱，表明水分子大部分热解离。

Conclusion: KELT-20 b的大气成分与其他超热木星相似，未发现动力学配置对其化学成分的显著影响。

Abstract: Ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) present a promising pathway for drawing a link
between a planet's composition and formation history. They retain both
refractory and volatiles species in gas phase in their atmospheres, which
allows us to place unique constraints on their building blocks. Here, we
present the 0.2 - 1.7 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Unlike other UHJs around
early-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin
axis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in
its composition. We observe a tremendous rise (>10 scale heights) in the
planet's transit depth at the near-UV wavelengths, akin to that observed for
WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b, and a muted water absorption feature in the near-IR.
Our retrievals indicate that the large NUV depth is driven by Fe II and/or SiO
and that the water is mostly thermally dissociated. Assuming equilibrium
chemistry, we obtain constraints on Z/H and O/H that indicate accretion of
volatile-rich solids and/or gas. Both our low resolution spectrum and the
refractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside
condensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the
planet's atmosphere. Within the precision limits of the HST spectra, no strong
evidence for limb asymmetry is detected. We contextualize this lack of
asymmetry by comparing to predictions from general circulation models with and
without the effects of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Lastly, we find no major
differences in the HST transmission spectra of KELT-20 b, WASP-178, and
WASP-121 b despite their different dynamical configurations.

### [3] [A constraint on the density of Jupiter's moon Thebe from primordial dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10109)
*Ian R. Brunton,Konstantin Batygin*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文预测了木星第六大卫星Thebe的平均密度和质量下限，并探讨了其与木星内部卫星起源模型的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前仅确定了木星系统中六个卫星的质量和密度，Thebe的密度和质量对其轨道演化模型至关重要。

Method: 通过模拟Amalthea和Thebe在木星盘时期的共振迁移，结合空气动力学阻力，推导Thebe的密度下限。

Result: Thebe的密度下限为1.0 g/cm³，质量下限为5×10²⁰ g，其较小半径需更高密度以维持轨道距离。

Conclusion: Thebe的质量测量将验证或否定木星内部卫星动力学演化的理论模型。

Abstract: Of the 97 known satellites in the Jovian system, the individual masses and
densities of each moon have only been determined for six of them: the four
Galileans, Amalthea, and Himalia. In this letter, we derive a prediction for
the mean density (and mass) of Thebe, Jupiter's sixth largest regular moon,
obtaining a lower limit of $\rho_\text{T}\gtrsim1.0$ g/cm$^3$
($m_\text{T}\gtrsim 5\times 10^{20}$ g). In particular, this value emerges as a
key constraint within the context of the resonant transport model for the
origins of Jupiter's interior satellites. Expanding on this theory, here we
carry out simulations of the simultaneous gravitational shepherding of Amalthea
and Thebe via the resonant influence of inward-migrating Io during Jupiter's
disk-bearing epoch. We find that owing to overstability of resonant dynamics
facilitated by the circumjovian disk's aerodynamic drag, Thebe's smaller radius
(compared to that of Amalthea's) requires a higher density to ensure its
terminal orbital distance exceeds that of Amalthea's, as it does today. With
multiple current and upcoming space missions devoted to in situ exploration of
the Jovian system, a proper measurement of Thebe's mass provides an avenue
towards empirical falsification or confirmation of our theoretical model for
the dynamical evolution of Jupiter's inner moons.

### [4] [The Perturbation Theory Approach to Stability in the Scattered Disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10119)
*Matthew Belyakov,Konstantin Batygin*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Batygin等人（2021）的模型，通过将海王星引力势的球谐展开扩展到八极及以上阶数，研究了更高阶共振对散射盘天体混沌行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究散射盘天体（SDOs）的混沌动力学行为，尤其是高阶共振对其轨道稳定性的影响。

Method: 采用球谐展开方法，将海王星引力势扩展到八极及以上阶数，分析高阶共振（如1:j、3:j等）对SDOs混沌行为的作用。

Result: 发现高阶共振（如2:j、3:j、4:j等）的相互交叉是导致SDOs局部混沌演化的主要原因，而非单一共振的独立作用。

Conclusion: 散射盘天体的混沌行为主要由高阶共振链的相互交叉驱动，这解释了其动力学分布的整体特征。

Abstract: Scattered disk objects (SDOs) are distant minor bodies that orbit the sun on
highly eccentric orbits, frequently with perhelia near Neptune's orbit.
Gravitational perturbations due to Neptune frequently lead to chaotic dynamics,
with the degree of chaotic diffusion set by an object's perihelion distance.
Batygin et al. (2021) developed a perturbative approach for scattered disk
dynamics, finding that, to leading order in semi-major axis ratio, an infinite
series of $2:j$ resonances drives the dynamics of the distant scattered disk,
with overlaps between resonances driving chaotic motion. In this work we extend
this model by taking the spherical harmonic expansion for Neptune's
gravitational potential to octupole order and beyond. In continuing the
expansion out to smaller semi-major axis limits, we find that the $1:j$ and
$3:j$ resonances that emerge in the octupole expansion do not individually set
new limits on the stability boundary. Instead, we find that for increasingly
Neptune-proximate orbits, resonances of progressively higher index are dominant
in explaining the emergence of chaotic behavior. In this picture, the mutual
intersections between series of $2:j$, $3:j$, $4:j \dots,$ resonant chains
explain local chaotic evolution of SDOs and shape the dynamical distribution of
the population at large.

### [5] [PLATOSpec's first results: planets WASP-35b and TOI-622b are on aligned orbits, and K2-237b is on a polar orbit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10145)
*J. Zak,P. Kabath,H. M. J. Boffin,J. Liptak,M. Skarka,R. Brahm,P. Gajdoš,A. Bocchieri,D. Itrich,L. Vanzi,P. Pintr,J. Janik,A. Hatzes*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文通过PLATOSpec仪器测量了三颗气态系外行星的自旋轨道角，揭示了不同的迁移路径，并强调了与大气测量结合的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自旋轨道角分布机制，以理解行星迁移路径，并通过结合大气测量提升系外行星研究。

Method: 使用PLATOSpec仪器测量Rossiter-McLaughlin效应，确定自旋轨道角（λ和ψ）。

Result: WASP-35b的λ与文献一致；TOI-622b轨道对齐，支持盘迁移；K2-237b极轨道表明无盘迁移。

Conclusion: 这些结果为行星形成和演化提供了新见解，并强调了未来大气表征的重要性。

Abstract: The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital
axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms
shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood.
Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a
powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between
ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect
measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous
exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152
Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda =
1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent
agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit
measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle
$\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with
quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and
$\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit,
which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting
previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely
populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting
stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens
tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are
compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these
dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their
formation and evolution.

### [6] [Replicating the flyby sampling of salty ocean world ice grains using impact ionization mass spectrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10169)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究通过新型超高速冰粒加速和撞击质谱法，量化了NaCl富集冰粒质谱受化学成分和撞击速度的影响，为未来Europa Clipper任务数据解读提供关键支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Europa Clipper任务将分析冰粒以评估Europa的化学组成和宜居性，但传统方法难以定量解析质谱数据。

Method: 采用新型超高速冰粒加速和撞击质谱法，研究NaCl富集冰粒质谱受成分和速度变化的影响。

Result: 研究表明，需高保真研究量化质谱中的成分和速度效应，以准确解读未来任务数据。

Conclusion: 高保真研究对解读Europa及其他海洋世界数据至关重要。

Abstract: The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and
analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact
mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical
composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional
information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically
proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact
velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft
velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice
grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree
to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical
composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges
planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that
high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in
impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at
Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.

### [7] [Thermospheric Density, Composition, and Temperature from GOES-R/SUVI Solar Occultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10242)
*Robert H. A. Sewell,Edward M. B. Thiemann,Jocelyn Lafyatis,Kevin Hallock,Christopher Bethge,Marcin Pilinski,Eric K. Sutton,Courtney L. Peck,Daniel B. Seaton*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种基于GOES-R卫星SUVI仪器的太阳掩星测量数据，开发了180至500公里高度范围内原子氧和分子氮数密度及热层温度的新数据集，并讨论了其方法和不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补热层温度和密度的实时测量空白，支持空间天气监测和预测。

Method: 利用SUVI的17.1、19.5和30.4 nm通道的EUV太阳掩星图像，开发了测量热层状态的新方法。

Result: 在250公里高度，O和N2的数密度随机不确定性分别为8%和17%，中性温度的不确定性为3%。与MSIS模型的比较显示，在安静太阳条件下密度差异显著。

Conclusion: 该数据集可通过NOAA GOES-R L2管道获取，预计将持续至2035年，为实时空间天气监测提供了重要支持。

Abstract: A new dataset of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen number density
profiles, along with thermospheric temperature profiles between 180 and 500 km,
has been developed. These profiles are derived from solar occultation
measurements made by SUVI on the GOES-R satellites, using the 17.1, 19.5, and
30.4 nm channels. Discussed is the novel approach and methods for using EUV
solar occultation images to measuring the thermospheric state. Measurement
uncertainties are presented as a function of tangent altitude. At 250 km,
number density random uncertainties are found to be 8% and 17% for O and N2,
respectively, and the random uncertainty for neutral temperature at 250 km was
found to be 3%. The impact of effective cross section uncertainty on retrieval
bias was assessed, revealing that, as expected, the largest effects occur where
O and N2 are minor absorbers. In contrast, total mass density and O/N2 ratios
exhibit substantially lower sensitivity, with biases that remain small or
nearly constant with altitude. Total mass density comparisons with the MSIS
model show good agreement at the dusk terminator, with an average difference of
-2%, but larger discrepancies at dawn, with an average difference of -26%.
These discrepancies are more prominent during quiet solar conditions,
suggesting an overestimation of densities by MSIS during these conditions.
Density comparisons with the IDEA and Dragster assimilative models show
dawn/dusk percent differences of -24%/-2% and +2%/+13%, respectively. The
dataset is available through the NOAA GOES-R L2 pipeline for eclipse seasons
from Sept. 2018 onward and is expected to continue through 2035. As this
measurement relies only on real-time NOAA space weather SUVI images, these
profiles could be produced in real-time, supporting critical space weather
monitoring and prediction, and filling in a current measurement gap of
thermospheric temperature and density.

Motivation: 研究冰粒子流入对行星形成的重要性及其与盘结构的关系。

Result: 冰粒子流入与尘埃间隙位置相关，支持早期有效间隙模型。

Conclusion: 冰粒子流入速率与行星形成模型一致，系统间差异可能影响行星系统架构和水含量。

Abstract: The influx of icy pebbles to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks
constitutes a fundamental ingredient in most planet formation theories. The
observational determination of the magnitude of this pebble flux and its
dependence on disk substructure (disk gaps as pebble traps) would be a
significant step forward. In this work we analyze a sample of 21 T Tauri disks
(with ages $\approx 0.5{-}2\mathrm{~Myr}$) using JWST/MIRI spectra
homogeneously reduced with the JDISCS pipeline and high-angular-resolution ALMA
continuum data. We find that the 1500/6000 K water line flux ratio measured
with JWST - a tracer of cold water vapor and pebble drift near the snowline -
correlates with the radial location of the innermost dust gap in ALMA continuum
observations (ranging from 8.7 to 69 au), confirming predictions from recent
models that study connections between the inner and outer disk reservoirs. We
develop a population synthesis exploration of pebble drift in gapped disks and
find a good match to the observed trend for early and relatively effective
gaps, while scenarios where pebble drift happens quickly, gaps are very leaky,
or where gaps form late are disfavored on a population level. Inferred snowline
pebble mass fluxes (ranging between $10^{-6}$ and
$10^{-3}~M_\oplus/\mathrm{yr}$ depending on gap position) are comparable to
fluxes used in pebble accretion studies and those proposed for the inner Solar
System, while system-to-system variations suggest differences in the emerging
planetary system architectures and water budgets.

TL;DR: 研究结合JWST的NIRSpec/G395H和G395M模式观测GJ 1132 b的大气层，发现其传输光谱与平坦线最吻合，可能仅存在极薄的大气层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GJ 1132 b是一个典型的M矮星岩石系外行星，因其轨道周期短且宿主星亮度高，是研究大气层的理想目标。

Method: 结合JWST的NIRSpec/G395H和G395M模式观测数据，分析传输光谱，并采用“留一观测法”评估恒星异质性影响。

Result: 传输光谱与平坦线最吻合，极薄的大气层解释仅部分数据支持，且不稳定。

Conclusion: GJ 1132 b可能是一个无大气层的裸岩行星。

Abstract: As an archetypal M-dwarf rocky exoplanet, GJ 1132 b has a varied history of
atmospheric measurements. At 1.13 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, 1.66 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, and
580 K, it orbits a bright, slowly rotating M dwarf in a 1.6-day period, making
it a prime target for characterization. In this study, we combine two JWST
NIRSpec/G395H transits previously reported by May and MacDonald et al. 2023
with two new NIRSpec/G395M transits to constrain the presence of an atmosphere.
This marks the first time the G395H and G395M modes have been combined for a
single target, and we report no difference in the quality of data between the
two modes. For rocky M-dwarf studies, G395H may still be preferred if stacking
transits to utilize the high-resolution flux-calibrated stellar spectra and
assess evolving stellar heterogeneity. GJ 1132 b's co-added transmission
spectrum is best-fit with a flat line. A thin steam atmosphere is also
consistent with the data, but this interpretation is driven almost entirely by
the first transit, which suggests an increase in cool spot coverage-fraction
derived from the flux-calibrated stellar spectra. This demonstrates the
importance of always considering stellar heterogeneity evolution in multi-visit
transits, and also the importance of a "leave-one-transit-out" approach in
modeling efforts of co-added transits. We combine these results with MIRI/LRS
emission data (Xue et al. 2024) to show that together, transmission and
emission are consistent with only the thinnest of atmospheres. Given GJ 1132
b's age and distance from the star, a thin atmosphere is not likely stable.
Therefore, the simplest explanation is that GJ 1132 b is indeed a bare rock.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在死区内边界（DZIB）处通过卵石吸积形成近地行星的条件，重点关注卵石大小和吸积率对卵石捕获效率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Inside-Out Planet Formation（IOPF）理论中卵石在DZIB处被捕获的条件，以确定行星形成的初始边界条件。

Method: 通过分析DZIB的径向位置与吸积率的关系，研究卵石大小对捕获效率的影响。

Result: 当吸积率降至约10^-9 M⊙/yr且DZIB位于0.1 au时，典型卵石大小为0.5 mm时捕获效率最高。

Conclusion: 该研究为IOPF理论提供了重要边界条件，并可能解释原行星盘中过渡盘相的首次出现。

Abstract: Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory of {\it in situ} formation via
pebble accretion of close-in Earth to Super-Earth mass planets at the pressure
maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB), whose location is
set initially by thermal ionization of alkali metals at $\sim1,200\:$K. With
midplane disk temperatures determined by viscous accretional heating, the
radial location of the DZIB depends on the accretion rate of the disk. Here, we
investigate the ability of pebbles to be trapped at the DZIB as a function of
the accretion rate and pebble size. We discuss the conditions that are needed
for pebble trapping to become efficient when the accretion rate drops to
$\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and the resulting DZIB is at $\sim
0.1\:$au, which is the expected evolutionary phase of the disk at the onset of
IOPF. This provides an important boundary condition for IOPF theory, i.e., the
properties of pebbles when planet formation begins. We find for our fiducial
model that typical pebble sizes of $\sim0.5\:$mm are needed for pebble trapping
to first become efficient at DZIBs near 0.1~au. This model may also provide an
explanation for the first emergence of the transition disk phase in
protoplanetary disks with accretion rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm
yr}^{-1}$.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习（ML）算法在预测潮汐锁定气态系外行星3D温度和风结构中的应用，通过训练密集神经网络（DNN）和决策树算法（XGBoost），实现了快速且可靠的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着望远镜技术的进步，对3D气候模型的需求增加，但传统GCM计算耗时且资源密集，ML提供了一种高效替代方案。

Method: 使用Exorad模拟60颗膨胀热木星，训练DNN和XGBoost预测温度和风场，并以PLATO观测目标为测试案例验证模型。

Result: DNN预测的温度与光谱计算结果高度一致，ML模拟器可可靠预测3D温度场，且对气体化学和云形成影响极小。

Conclusion: ML模拟器为系外行星研究提供了快速工具，可补充传统GCM网格，适用于大规模系外行星研究。

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.
