*Sukdev Mahapatra*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 研究发现半径谷的位置随恒星类型变化：M矮星约1.6地球半径，G/K星约1.8地球半径，F星约1.9地球半径，支持恒星依赖过程塑造半径谷的观点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半径谷（超级地球和亚海王星之间的行星缺失区域）是行星形成和大气演化的关键诊断特征，研究其如何依赖恒星类型有助于理解行星形成机制

Method: 分析NASA系外行星档案的凌星数据，选择轨道周期<100天的行星，按宿主恒星光谱类型（M、K、G、F）分组，构建加权半径分布并应用统计检验量化谷深

Result: 发现半径谷位置随恒星类型系统变化：M矮星约1.6R⊕，G/K星约1.8R⊕，F星约1.9R⊕

Conclusion: 结果支持半径谷由恒星依赖过程（如光致蒸发、核驱动质量损失和轨道迁移）塑造的观点

Abstract: The radius valley -- a deficit of exoplanets between super-Earths and
sub-Neptunes -- is a key diagnostic of planet formation and atmospheric
evolution. We investigate how the radius valley depends on stellar type by
analyzing an updated, transit-only sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet
Archive. Planets are selected with $P < 100$ days and divided by host spectral
class (M, K, G, F). We construct weighted radius distributions and apply
statistical tests to quantify the valley depth. We recover a pronounced valley
centered near $\sim 1.8\,R_\oplus$ for G/K stars, but shifted to $\sim
1.6\,R_\oplus$ for M dwarfs and $\sim 1.9\,R_\oplus$ for F stars. These results
support the view that the radius valley is shaped by stellar-dependent
processes such as photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and orbital
migration.

*Aviad Levis,Nhan Luong,Richard Teague,Katherine. L. Bouman,Marcelo Barraza-Alfaro,Kevin Flaherty*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理约束神经场和可微分渲染的计算框架RadJAX，用于原行星盘的三维结构重建，相比传统方法速度提升高达10,000倍，成功揭示了HD 163296盘中CO富集层的垂直形态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原行星盘是行星形成的场所，ALMA望远镜的极高分辨率要求超越传统方法的建模技术来解析其三维结构。

Method: 开发了RadJAX框架，将物理约束的神经场与可微分渲染相结合，构建了GPU加速的完全可微分线辐射传输求解器。

Result: 应用于HD 163296的ALMA CO观测数据，成功恢复了CO富集层的垂直形态，发现在400天文单位以外存在明显的变窄和平坦化特征，这是现有方法未能发现的。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了提取复杂盘结构的新范式，推动了我们对原行星演化过程的理解。

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture
features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational
framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable
rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature
missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting
complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary
evolution.

### [3] [A JWST/MIRI view of k Andromedae b: Refining its mass, age, and physical parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03624)
*N. Godoy,E. Choquet,E. Serabyn,M. Malin,P. Tremblin,C. Danielski,P. O. Lagage,A. Boccaletti,B. Charnay,M. E. Ressler*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 使用JWST/MIRI中红外数据结合近红外测量，对kAndb亚恒星伴星进行精确表征，显著改善了温度、半径、重力加速度等参数精度，确定其质量略高于氘燃烧极限，年龄与Columba星协一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: kAndb作为位于行星-褐矮星边界附近的亚恒星伴星，其年龄和质量估计存在十年争议，大气参数约束较差，需要更精确的观测数据来减少不确定性。

Method: 获取JWST/MIRI日冕数据，重新校准近红外测光数据，使用中红外颜色-星等图分析物种可能性，比较颜色和星等与等龄线，通过大气模型和演化模型拟合光谱能量分布。

Result: 最佳拟合为多云大气模型，得到年龄47±7 Myr，质量17.3±1.8 MJup，温度1791±68 K，半径1.42±0.06 RJup，重力加速度4.35±0.07 dex，各项参数精度提升30-70%。

Conclusion: 新质量确定kAndb略高于氘燃烧极限，年龄精度提升75%且与Columba星协一致，温度表明存在硅酸盐云，MIRI数据对改善半径和温度测量至关重要，从而强化了对年龄和质量的约束。

Abstract: Context. kAndb is a substellar companion near the planet-brown dwarf
boundary, orbiting a B9IV star at 50-100 au. Estimates of its age and mass
vary, fueling a decade-long debate. Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K,
log(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and
heterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using
mid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR
measurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in
age and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C,
F1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar
model. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species
(CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to
isochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy
distribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to
constrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere
models fit best, consistent with the L0/L2 spectral type and position near
silicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7
Myr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling
yielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by
30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous
best value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the
deuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the
Columba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring
spectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and
temperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving
the overall characterization of kAndb.

### [4] [Proto-planetary disk composition-dependent element volatility in the context of rocky planet formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03724)
*Rob J. Spaargaren,Oliver Herbort,Haiyang S. Wang,Stephen J. Mojzsis,Paolo Sossi*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究通过模拟1000种不同初始盘成分的凝聚序列，分析了元素挥发性对系外岩质行星成分多样性的影响，发现行星成分与盘C/O比密切相关，并预测了比以往更广泛的岩质行星成分范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳系岩质天体的成分相对于太阳存在分馏，元素耗损与挥发性相关。但由于元素挥发性取决于盘气体成分，太阳-地球场景中的元素分馏趋势不一定适用于其他行星系统，因此需要研究不同盘成分下元素挥发性如何影响岩质行星的成分多样性。

Method: 基于观测到的恒星丰度，模拟了1000种初始盘成分的凝聚序列，参数化了元素50%凝聚温度对盘成分的依赖性，并将具有适当元素挥发性的元素分馏趋势应用于恒星丰度，模拟具有与地球相同挥发性耗损模式的岩质系外行星成分。

Result: 研究发现：地球类行星出现在低C/O比盘中；含石墨行星出现在中高C/O比盘中；识别出中间C/O比类行星，其特征是Mg和Si耗损，导致Fe、Ca和Al相对丰度较高。脱挥发分模式可适应盘成分依赖的凝聚温度来预测单个系统中岩质行星的整体成分。

Conclusion: 考虑盘成分依赖的凝聚温度意味着我们可以预期岩质行星可能的成分范围比以往认为的更广泛，这为理解系外岩质行星的多样性提供了新的视角和预测框架。

Abstract: The compositions of the Solar System terrestrial bodies are fractionated from
that of the Sun, where elemental depletions in the bulk rocky bodies correlate
with element volatility, expressed in its 50% condensation temperature.
However, because element volatility depends on disk gas composition, it is not
mandated that elemental fractionation trends derived from the solar-terrestrial
scenario apply to other planetary systems. Here, we expand upon previous
efforts to quantify element volatility during disk condensation, and how this
affects rocky planet compositional diversity.
  We simulate condensation sequences for a sample of 1000 initial disk
compositions based on observed stellar abundances. We present parametrisations
of how element 50% condensation temperatures depend on disk composition, and
apply element fractionation trends with appropriate element volatilty to
stellar abundances to simulate compositions of rocky exoplanets with the same
volatile depletion pattern as the Earth, providing a robust and conservative
lower limit to the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets.
  Here we show that Earth-like planets emerge from low-C-to-O disks and
graphite-bearing planets from medium-to-high-C-to-O disks. Furthermore, we
identify an intermediate-C-to-O class of planets characterized by Mg and Si
depletion, leading to relatively high abundances of Fe, Ca, and Al. We show
that devolatilisation patterns could be adapted potentially with disk
composition-dependent condensation temperatures to make predictions of rocky
planet bulk compositions within individual systems. The outcomes of our
analysis suggest that accounting for disk composition-dependent condensation
temperatures means that we can expect an even broader range of possible rocky
planet compositions than has previously been considered.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binary stars are evolved systems that
host circumbinary discs formed through mass loss during late-stage binary
interaction. Their structural, kinematic, and chemical similarities to
planet-forming discs have motivated the idea that these systems may act as
sites of "second-generation" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether
the gravitational instability mechanism - a proposed pathway for giant planet
formation in some protoplanetary discs-can operate in post-AGB discs. Using the
Toomre criterion under well-motivated assumptions for disc structure and size,
mass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational
instability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using several
well-studied protoplanetary disc systems before applying the same analysis to
observed post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally
gravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. The disks
were stable against collapse, even when accounting for potentially higher disk
mass in the past. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the
same way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases
early on. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the
post-common envelope system NN Serpentis first carried out by Schleicher and
Dreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under
specific, high disc mass assumptions, however we note that their proposed disc
mass is unlikely. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical
assessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that
this mechanism is unlikely to dominate second-generation planet formation in
these systems, and underscoring the need to explore alternative pathways-such
as core accretion-in future studies

### [6] [A Full-Atmosphere Model of Jupiter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04034)
*Antonín Knížek,Paul B. Rimmer,Martin Ferus*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合光化学和热化学动力学的木星大气模型，覆盖从1100巴到7.4×10^-11巴的压力范围，首次在大气区域中整合硫化学，成功预测了NH3-NH4SH混合云层和HCN形成区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补木星大气不同区域现有模型之间的空白，首次在大气区域中整合硫化学，提供更全面的木星大气化学描述。

Method: 开发了结合1D光化学-热化学动力学的模型，使用更新版的STAND反应网络，包含更新的NH4SH化学和Antoine方程参数。

Result: 模型成功描述了木星主要观测化学特征，预测了0.1-1巴之间的NH3-NH4SH混合云层，在平流层发现HCN形成区域（最大混合比33ppb），预测N2混合比为490ppm。

Conclusion: 该模型成功连接了木星大气不同区域的现有模型，并做出了多个可观测验证的新化学物种预测，为木星大气化学研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a combined 1D photochemical-thermochemical kinetics model
of Jupiter's deeper atmosphere, troposphere and stratosphere. The model covers
atmospheric pressure range from $1.1 \times 10^{3}$ bar to $7.4 \times
10^{-11}$ bar and is the first model that incorporates sulfur chemistry when
spanning an atmospheric region of this extent. This model incorporates a new
version of the STAND reaction network with updated NH4SH chemistry, and updated
Antoine equation parameters for NH4SH and H2S. Validation against current
models of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as recent observational data shows that
our model successfully describes Jupiter's main observed chemical features.
Since one of the focuses of the model is the chemistry on nitrogen, it
correctly predicts the formation of a mixed NH3-NH4SH cloud layer between 0.1
and 1 bar. It also describes the chemistry of HCN throughout the atmosphere and
discovers a region in the stratosphere between $1 \times 10^{-6}$ and $6.76
\times 10^{-8}$ bar, where HCN forms through radical chemistry with maximum
mixing ratio 33 ppb at $2.94 \times 10^{-7}$ bar -- a prediction testable by
observations. At the same time, our model predicts a quenched N2 mixing ratio
490 ppm up to 10$^{-6}$ bar. The model therefore successfully bridges the gap
between existing models of separate regions of Jupiter's atmosphere and makes
new testable predictions of several chemical species.

### [7] [Stellar occultations in support of the LUMIO orbit determination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04177)
*Davide Banzi,Riccardo Lasagni Manghi,Marco Zannoni*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 利用恒星掩星观测增强LUMIO月球轨道探测器导航性能的研究，通过精确测量恒星被月球遮挡的时间来提高轨道确定精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学观测阶段，无线电跟踪稀疏且光照条件限制传统光学导航方法时，需要寻找替代导航方案来提升轨道确定性能

Method: 基于JPL MONTE库开发仿真工具识别有效掩星事件，结合几何和光照约束，将掩星观测数据与常规无线电数据集成到批处理最小二乘轨道确定滤波器中

Result: 掩星观测使LUMIO横向和法向位置不确定性降低达两倍，特别是在跟踪间隙或掩星丰富弧段，对100米以下的月球形状不确定性依赖有限

Conclusion: 掩星导航在低能见度环境下能增强航天器自主性和鲁棒性，是未来月球和深空任务中无线电技术的有价值补充

Abstract: This work investigates the use of stellar occultation measurements to enhance
the orbit determination performance of the Lunar Meteoroid Impact Observer
(LUMIO) mission, operating from a quasi-Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon L2
point. During science phases, when radiometric tracking is sparse and low
illumination limits conventional optical navigation methods, occultation
events, defined as precise timings of stellar appearances/disappearances behind
the Moon's limb, offer a suitable alternative. A simulation tool based on JPL's
MONTE library was developed to identify valid occultation events, applying
geometric and illumination constraints to exclude non-observable cases. These
events were integrated into a batch least-squares orbit determination filter
alongside conventional radiometric data. The covariance analysis shows that
occultation observables reduce the transverse and normal position uncertainties
of LUMIO by up to a factor of two, especially during tracking gaps or
occultation-rich arcs. This uncertainty reduction is expected to facilitate
station-keeping operations and constrain the surface localization of Lunar
Impact Flashes (LIFs), enhancing the mission's scientific return. Sensitivity
analyses confirm that the orbit determination performance is primarily driven
by the timing accuracy of occultation events, with limited dependence on lunar
shape uncertainty below 100 m. These findings confirm the potential of
occultation-based navigation to enhance spacecraft autonomy and robustness in
low-visibility environments, making it a valuable complement to radiometric
techniques for future lunar and deep-space missions.

*Amelia J. Cordwell,Alexandros Ziampras,Joshua J. Brown,Roman R. Rafikov*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文重新推导了2D行星-盘相互作用的Navier-Stokes方程，提出了新的引力势表示方法，并通过大量2D和3D模拟测试发现Bessel型势能是最佳选择，但2D模拟仍无法完全匹配3D结果，可能导致行星质量低估约两倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行星-盘相互作用虽然是三维现象，但通常使用二维"薄盘"近似进行研究。二维模拟能否定量匹配三维结果很大程度上取决于行星势能的处理方式，而传统的"平滑长度"参数存在不确定性，需要寻找更好的二维引力力表示方法。

Method: 详细重新推导了行星-盘相互作用的二维Navier-Stokes方程，提出新的力表示方法。进行了大量二维和三维模拟测试，比较了新提出的力表示方法和传统平滑势能的表现。

Result: Bessel型势能是最优的二维行星势能表示方法，但即使使用该方法，二维模拟也无法正确重现总力矩随背景梯度的标度关系，最多只能将单侧Lindblad力矩和间隙宽度匹配到10%的水平。基于标准二维模拟的观测间隙结构分析可能系统性地低估行星质量约两倍。

Conclusion: 二维模拟在定量匹配三维行星-盘相互作用方面存在根本性限制，即使使用最优的Bessel型势能表示，也无法完全重现三维效应。这对基于二维模拟的行星质量估计和速度扭结观测分析具有重要影响。

Abstract: Planet--disc interactions, despite being fundamentally three-dimensional, are
often studied in the two-dimensional `thin-disk' approximation. The overall
morphology of planet--disc interactions has ben shown to be similar in both 2D
and 3D simulations, however, the ability of a 2D simulation to quantitatively
match 3D results depends strongly on how the potential of the planet is
handled. Typically, the 2D planetary potential is smoothed out using some
`smoothing length', a free parameter, for which different values have been
proposed, depending on the particular aspect of the interaction focused on. In
this paper, we re-derive 2D Navier--Stokes in detail for planet--disc
interactions to find better ways to represent the 2D gravitational force. We
perform a large suite of 2D and 3D simulations to test these force
prescriptions. We identify the parts of the interaction that are fundamentally
3D, and test how well our new force prescriptions, as well as traditional
smoothed potentials, are able to match 3D simulations. Overall, we find that
the optimal way to represent the planetary potential is the `Bessel-type
potential', but that even in this case 2D simulations are unable to reproduce
the correct scaling of the total torque with background gradients, and are at
best able match the one-sided Lindblad torque and gap widths to level of 10 per
cent. We find that analysis of observed gap structures based on standard 2D
simulations may systematically underestimate planetary masses by a factor of
two, and discuss the impacts of 3D effects on observations of velocity kinks.

### [9] [The changing transit shape of TOI-3884 b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04297)

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: TOI-3884 b是一个亚土星大小的系外行星，围绕完全对流M型矮星运行。研究发现其凌星形状具有色差和不对称性，这是由于恒星黑子持续穿越造成的。通过3年观测发现黑子构型变化，测量出了精确的自旋轨道角度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究完全对流M型矮星周围大质量行星的形成和演化机制，通过精确测量自旋轨道角度来理解行星系统的形成历史。

Method: 使用瑞士1.2米欧拉望远镜进行为期3年的光度凌星观测，追踪恒星黑子构型变化，测量自旋轨道角度。

Result: 发现凌星形状随时间变化，测量得到天空投影自旋轨道角λ=37.3±1.5°，真实自旋轨道角ψ=54.3±1.4°，黑子中心与恒星极有5.64±0.64°的微小不对齐。

Conclusion: 精确的自旋轨道角度测量结合未来JWST的大气特征分析，对理解完全对流恒星周围近距离大质量行星的形成演化至关重要。

Abstract: TOI-3884 b is a sub-Saturn transiting a fully convective M-dwarf.
Observations indicate that the transit shape is chromatic and asymmetric as a
result of persistent starspot crossings. This, along with the lack of
photometric variability of the host star, indicates that the rotational axis of
the star is tilted along our line of sight and the planet-occulted starspot is
located close to the stellar pole. We acquired photometric transits over a
period of three years with the Swiss 1.2-meter Euler telescope to track changes
in the starspot configuration and detect any signs of decay or growth. The
shape of the transit changes over time, and so far no two observations match
perfectly. We conclude that the observed variability is likely not caused by
changes in the temperature and size of the spot, but due to a slight (5.64
$\pm$ 0.64$^{\circ}$) misalignment between the spot center and the stellar
pole, i.e., a small spin-spot angle ($\Theta$). In addition, we were able to
obtain precise measurements of the sky-projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$)
of 37.3 $\pm$ 1.5\degree, and the true spin-orbit angle ($\psi$) of 54.3 $\pm$
1.4\degree. The precise alignment measurements along with future atmospheric
characterisation with the James Webb Space Telescope will be vital for
understanding the formation and evolution of close-in, massive planets around
fully convective stars.
